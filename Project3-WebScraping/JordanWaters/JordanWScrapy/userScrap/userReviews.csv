"I wound up at Paowalla under slightly unusual circumstances, during a small bachelor party for a British friend. He already had a proper stag-do in England, but four of us decided to take him out for a low-key evening of festivities. <br><br>After drinks on Stone Street, there was much discussion of where to go. Steak wasn't an option, so I wound up suggesting we try this relatively new Indian space in SoHo.<br><br>I say the circumstances were unusual in that we had a couple of diners who wouldn't normally be eating this ambitious Indian fare, along with the celebrant and I who very much did want to try some things on offer. <br><br>I was worried we were headed for a straight up disaster when one diner declared they wanted chicken tikka masala and not to share food, but once we cleaved him off from the main group we were free to order on our own. <br><br>We went to town, getting several small plates and three mains to share around a group of three. It was probably about 40% too much food, but at least it gave a chance to go through a good chunk of the menu. <br><br>What worked was pretty varied. A tomato dish marinated in spices was surprising for how much it let us take in the flavor of the raw vegetable. Usually Indian food is so much about the long simmer that this was great change of pace. Elsewhere the gooey fried cheese inside the kulcha was a greasy late night snack transported to the beginning of the meal. Chili chicken was every bit the revelation I had the first time I sampled it on the streets of Calcutta. <br><br>Not everything was a hit. The burrata in dal was far too much of a mash-up without a point. It was just a dish from India with some Italian cheese floating on top. And the roganjosh had an off-putting flavor just seemed to leech into a very nicely cooked plate of meat. <br><br>Even though we ate at the bar, I found the experience more relaxed and refined than either of my two meals at Babu Ji. And while the price point isn't cheap, I got far more out of this take on Indian food than that one a mile to the northeast.  And even the person who got the chicken tikka masala seemed satisfied.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Paowalla
"I live up in North Brooklyn, so sampling these Caribbean places with no seating and great take out can be difficult. That's why I love that this Gloria's has a single, table-cloth covered elevated table in the restaurant. <br><br>This allowed me to stop in and enjoy a nice dinner enroute to feeding my friend's cats who live around the block. (The cats were so hungry I wouldn't have been able to eat in the apartment in piece.)<br><br>I got the curry chicken with some great pigeon peas and daal mixed in. It was, somewhat predictably, excellent. The flavor is nice and spicy, with the freshness that comes from a busy kitchen and high neighborhood expectations. I couldn't finish more than half the meal, but certainly got my $10 worth. <br><br>There was friendly service, an nice explanation of the sides on offer, and a generally well run operation. Probably my favorite of the six Caribbean restaurants I've eaten at in this section of Prospect Heights.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Gloria’s West Indian Food
"Can't say I detected too much of a difference between the coal oven and other pizza ovens. Does this make me a pizza philistine? Perhaps. <br><br>But I did put this place to the standard slice test - I had a slice or two after a couple of after work beers in the neighborhood. The margarita slice is relatively standard; I wasn't blown away by any of the ingredients or the general presentation. It looks and tastes thin - which is nice, but really the whole thing just melts away pretty quickly. <br><br>I probably won't wander back over to this place, but certainly there's nothing wrong the pie here. Whether or not it should be a frozen pizza empire, I really can't say.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Table 87 Coal Oven Pizza
"Buffalo's Famous  seems designed to annoy the very upstaters it invokes with its name. There's a very specific city here - Buffalo - yet the menu wanders all over the western part of the state, to Syracuse and Rochester and even further east. <br><br>It seems odd that in this era of hyper-specific restaurant themes that a single city wouldn't be enough for a menu, but who knows. I didn't write the business plan. If I did I certain wouldn't pull any punches in calling a garbage plate a garbage plate, or offer so many different ways to change it up. <br><br>Fortunately the actual food here is solid, no matter the theme. There are just a few seats and an open door - this place is punching above its size in press coverage - so come on a nice night or be ready to wait. The majority of my meal was an impressively spicy set of buffalo wings, a generous portion that left me going for not one but two seltzers during the course of the meal. Milk shakes, in a bewildering combination of flavors are also available, but seemed a bit heavy considering the spicy meat. <br><br>So let's make an already small menu smaller and really celebrate what makes Buffalo great.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Buffalo’s Famous
"I took the plunge earlier this year and decided to take some Russian classes through Fluent City. I had signed up through another company and found the class cancelled due to low enrollment. <br><br>Fluent City's been a great experience. I've taken Russian 1 and 2 through the company, in addition to a private lesson for a week I've missed. I really like our instructor, who I think provides a nice mix of encouragement while also ensuring we make progress. Lessons are quite varied, with individual activities and discussion, dialogues and Russian cultural materials. <br><br>We have homework but it's not too intense - it's definitely set up for different types of learners. If you need a strictly academic environment you might want to look elsewhere, but for people looking to start or add to written and speaking skills in a language, I definitely recommend Fluent City.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Fluent City
"A review of Ed and Bev's, which is inside Berg'n. <br><br>I needed something to eat in between a couple of beers at an afternoon hang at Berg'n. I went with a hot dog and some fries. It's a perfectly serviceable dog, which doesn't seem to measure up to some of the best I've had down on Coney Island or out in the great hot dog states of the northeast and midwest. <br><br>I still say that the best default place in Berg'n is Lumpia Shack, especially now that Bklyn Burro  has moved out to its own space. The beer here is better than the food.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Berg’n
"An old standby in the theater district, the Russian Vodka Room might be good for a meeting with Bruce Vilanch on an upcoming awards show, but as a place to actually eat and drink things it comes up short. <br><br>The Russian menu is relatively standard, along with the inclusion of several American and European dishes for people who come to a place called the Russian Vodka room and are afraid to order actual Russian food. Not that my dish of pelmeni were any better than the ones you get frozen at Russian markets for a dollar or two, they just cost far more. <br><br>They have two beers on draft, neither of which are Russian or particularly good. There's a large selection of infused vodka. They tend towards the sweet and really don't measure up to some of the more ambitious creations at a place like Masha &amp; the Bear in Williamsburg. <br><br>As they say, this is one of those places you don't come for the food. A man starts playing the piano around 7. There's a faded elegance to the dark features of the bar. As the alcohol sinks in, this seems like a perfectly fine place to the pass the evening.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Russian Vodka Room
"I take classes in this part of town, which means there are many Thursdays where it's 9 p.m. and I'm hungry. I'm not with anyone, nor do I want to wait very long for food. <br><br>Woorijip fits the bill nicely. There's a consistently strong buffet, of which I like the noodle options and a chance for a couple pieces of spicy rice cake. There's also a large section of prepackaged meals, from bentos to rice bowls and larger versions of what is on the buffet. Signs inform diners that the food is strictly regulated about the time it can spend outside. <br><br>Even after 9 p.m. (or during the middle of the day) this place is always crowded, so the food turns over quickly and is very dependable. Bonus points to the sides of rice that are available at the counter for just over a $1 - there's no reason to waste buffet money on this heavy staple. <br><br>The whole place feels like the fullest realization of the concept. It's a perfect place for quick and budget Korean food that will satisfy.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Woorijip Authentic Korean Food
"Much like Danny's a few blocks to the south, Carmine's is a slice shop that has sprouted a full service restaurant off to one side. Unlike Danny's, the slices here are actually worth eating. <br><br>It's crowded on the Saturday afternoon when I come, grabbing a couple slices of the vodka pizza while waiting for a matte to placed in a photo frame around the corner. There are children with parents, a few people carbing up after a night out, and even what appears to be an entire rock band, all waiting for slices. <br><br>There's a strict separation between the restaurant/sports bar and the slice joint. Only waiters are allowed to cut between the spaces. <br><br>I didn't test out a plain slice, but the square vodka slices had the perfect amount of kick to go with the extra dough of the Silican-style pie. They were filling and nicely cooked. A good alternative when I'm in this area.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Carmine’s Pizzeria
"Cafe China has a Michelin star. It hangs over every bite at this midtown eatery. Is this truly the best Chinese restaurant in Manhattan? Why is it honored and not other places?<br><br>The inside is a few hints of Chinoiserie mixed with antique store finds - old light fixtures, middle school desks - and warm, yellow light. On a Tuesday night when I visit with my uncle it's packed. He's able to snag the last two seats at the bar, which mean we don't have to wait for nearly 45 minutes for the next available table. <br><br>The menu is long, with plenty of choices designed to make sure even the pickiest Chinese food eater won't be challenged. There is wonton soup and veggie pot stickers, bok chop with garlic and kung pao chicken. I am being uncharitable, as there are also some interesting selection from Sichuan and elsewhere. Few neighborhood takeout joints serve pickle fish stew or mung bean jelly, let alone sautéed loofah. <br><br>I ordered for the table, and we wound up with pork dumplings in chili oil, double cooked pork and the cumin lamb. The dumplings carried a profound sense of missing flavor. I missed the ""ma"" and the ""la"" that would be actually present in true Sichuan preparations. The cumin lamb and pork fared better - the obviously quality and skill in the meat bases really helped. <br><br>None of the dishes here match up to the best the found in Flushing. And while I appreciate the surroundings and the long beer menu, it's ultimately hard to justify paying these prices (and dealing with the pretension here) to have food that's just not operating on the level it pretends to be.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Café China
"Mesa felt very odd six years ago, as if someone planned a restaurant for SoHo and then decided at the last minute to come to Williamsburg. The neighborhood has changed enough that this place no longer sticks out so much, but it does still feel a bit apart from the surroundings. <br><br>When I first moved to the neighborhood, I dismissed this place as an ""upscale spot for yuppies in their 30s.""  Of course I'm now a bit of a yuppie and definitely in my 30s. Is it any surprise I found myself feeling slightly warmer on this place on a couple of recent visits?<br><br>This is slightly-fancy Mexican food designed for white people, but it is at least good slight-fancy Mexican food designed for white people. The margaritas come in several surprising flavors, are strong without being too sweet.<br><br>No one will be mad for choosing this place, although truly great Mexican food is found farther to the east, at places with much lower decorating budgets.  Eating outside (on sidewalk chairs, there is unfortunately no backyard) is a great way to watch the beards, dogs and tight pants go by while seated.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Mesa Coyoacan
"I was waiting for my food when it happened. <br><br>A man, black, maybe in his late 40s, went to pay his check. When presented with the bill, he came very aggravated and started arguing with the manager on duty. ""What is this charge at the end of the bill?"" he demanded. The manager said it was a gratuity, which only set him off further. <br><br>""I work hard, I'm not paying an extra three dollars on our food,"" he said this no less than six times for emphasis. This went on for nearly 10 minutes. <br><br>Now the man eventually left, and did not leave a tip or pay the gratuity. When I presented the bill, there was no surcharge. It was a clear case of racial profiling. <br><br>It's possible to argue some sort of moral equivalency here - the owner being wrong for applying a surcharge to a group of people, while the man was wrong for not leaving a tip. But that's not how it works. The restaurant is a business, and how it treats one customer reflects on the whole business. <br><br>Perhaps these retrograde policies were acceptable in the Koch administration. I can say the same for the food. My bowl of wonton soup, with noodles and roast pork, was a mess. There was quite a big of lettuce - a strange filler that doesn't belong in this bowl. It was as tasteless as the roast pork, which was missing the crunch and juicyness of proper char siu. The chili sauce I was offered was old and oddly lumply. <br><br>The whole place has a aura of days gone by. Unfortunately these aren't the good old days, these are times better off forgotten.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,1,Hoy Wong Restaurant
"There's no real point in reviewing specific bowls of noodles from Ramen Lab, since the person making them is constantly changing. So rather, let me just say that the concept is excellent. No one can go to Japan every month on food tasting trips, so this is a good way for chefs to come, have a residency and get food. <br><br>Some of the featured chefs have gone on to create their own restaurants, and what is here is a sneak preview. <br><br>Whoever is here, the place is small and turns over quickly. The absolute best time to come is early in the week (even for lunch) on a good day. I went on a recent Monday and the wait was under 5 minutes. For those willing to brave the cold or rain, the line can look longer than it actually is. <br><br>Come, have a great bowl of ramen, and then leave a few minutes later. It's fast, efficient, fun eating.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Ramen Lab
"On New Year's Eve 2010, Korzo hosted an event that involved unlimited beer and a plate of food for $35 or so. Snowed in and unable to get to a party elsewhere in these pre-Uber days, my roommates and I walked the two blocks to Korzo. <br><br>That night ended with me destroying an island and vomiting in a sinkful of dishes.<br><br>We all can't stay that young forever, and eventually life took me north to Williamsburg and away from Korzo. But after a bowling party in Sunset Park, I grabbed a few friends and went to see how the old bird was aging. <br><br>The answer is pretty well. Those famous fried burgers are still here, still able to catch all of the wonderful juices of meat. along with the flavor of the cheese (and bacon and mustard) wrapped inside. It's not as heavy as it might seem, as the relatively thinness of the dough compensates for the way it is prepared. <br><br>The mania this restaurant (and its now-dead East Village spin-off Korzo Haus) have for beet ketchup has now died down. Regular ketchup and barbecue sauce are now available, along with the beet stuff for those are interested. <br><br>Things are a bit more upscale, with the menu divided into ""firsts"" and ""seconds"" - along with a whole variety of different fried burgers. And while some favorites are gone - where are all those Hungarian breads? And didn't this place used to make great spaetzle - there's still plenty of variety, both Hungarian, Sloakvian and more American. <br><br>So if I lived in the neighborhood, this would still be very much in rotation. And if they have regular ketchup on the menu, I will still make it down here form time to time.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Korzo
"It's probably the best dim sum in the city. <br><br>I haven't been to every hall (it's too tempting to go for other food when in Flushing) but based on a few trips over a few years, this seems to be the most solid option. <br><br>There are pushy cart ladies, a man who stands in the center of the room furiously calling numbers in Cantonese, shared tables and pots of refilled tea. Dining here is high volume, high energy, with an emphasis on a quick turnover time.<br><br>Come, grab a few plates of food and then walk through Sunset Park and Bay Ridge to burn off the calories. <br><br>The usual suspects - har gow, siu mai, cheun fun - are done right here. Even better are the premium dishes, like the fried squid with a side of chili sauce or the succulent zongzi stuffed with pork.<br><br>I may find places to quibble - why is the dan tat not seared on the top - but dim sum is essential weekend dining experience, and this is the top of the New York pecking order. That means the only appropriate rating is five stars.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,East Harbor Seafood Palace
"I am mystified by the good rankings for this place. <br><br>My BBQ chicken slice was a disaster. This is white slice,with no red sauce. The BBQ sauce surrounding the chicken is designed to be a substitute, but the sweet brown stuff barely struggled to stay afloat under mounds of cheese. The chicken had a very dry, almost industrial quality to it, as if it came from supermarket surplus many weeks before. <br><br>The pizzaiolo reheated it for several minutes in the oven, perhaps in a vain attempt to revive the slice. All was lost. Instead cheese flowed over the bounds of the thin crust, causing me to sheepishly approach the counter for a knife and fork. <br><br>Picture this sad sight - a man, eating a tasteless triangle of cheese and bread with utensils, in a nearly empty dining room. Slowly, he realizes why the adjoining tables are empty.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,1,Ginos Pizzeria
"The idea that this far stretch of Eastern Williamsburg can support a Taiwanese restaurant is an exciting proposition. I anxiously waited through the long months as Win Son (née Winsome) rose from a long abandoned Puerto Rican restaurant on the corner of Montrose and Graham Avenue. <br><br>After two visits - one during the ""soft"" opening and one shortly launch - I think it's clear that while there are many solid elements, the restaurant isn't quite fully formed. <br><br>I'll start with what I liked, because it's a sizable list. The inside space is inviting, softly lit with a largely white interior. I love that they kept elements of the old aluminum awnings, all with a new interior. The servers are very friendly, ready to tell a story and refill drinks at the same time. <br><br>I appreciate the deep drink list, which includes several surprising draft beers, more than half a dozen cocktails and wine. I found my cocktails on both occasions to be strong in both flavor and alcohol, mixing in spice and unusual ingredients in combinations that were very drinkable.<br><br>Where I get concerned is in the overall direction of the menu. There are no Taiwanese restaurants for miles around, so this can be a vital place to get dishes not available elsewhere. I thought the very first iteration of the menu sometimes seemed to sacrifice great taste for ""clever"" updates on classic dishes. The best example of this was the three cups chicken (sometimes just called san bei ji on English menus) where the juicy chunks of chicken meat had been swapped out for fried chicken livers.<br><br>I'm glad this dish is gone on the most recent version of the menu, although I hope it returns in a more traditional version. Also appearing recently is a ""scallion pancake,"" which is really more of a roti with an excellent chili oil sauce. The zhajiangmian is a great weekday dish, lighter than it would be served in China's northeast with the addition of lamb. It's not exactly traditional,but it's also not fussy, and tastes great. <br><br>I see Win Son is closed today, Memorial Day. The sign on the front door promises behind the scenes they are working to create an ever better, more delicious experience. I don't doubt that - and I have high hopes for this restaurant as it continues to evolve and grow in the months to come.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Win Son
"The night after I stopped into this Mexican deli in the Bronx driving back from Connecticut I had a dream. I was back at Tulcimex where the actual bodega looked largely the same. But the space was now bigger. The wall facing the street had been replaced with an open space, and then a large dining room. What was once a three table operation had 20, along with a dartboard and a dancefloor.<br><br>I imagine this was my subconscious confirming what I'd tell any person that asked - this place makes a mean torta. You don't have to come all the way up here to get a good Mexican sandwich, but the odds of the combination of stringy cheese, beans, tomato, lettuce and chorizo coming out right are certainly higher in this area. Under a soccer match, and protected by The Virgin of Guadalupe, I waited for and the ate my sandwich.<br><br>I wish there were proper agua frescas (only in the summer, I was told) or even the Jarrito's soda water (instead of just flavors) but these are minor complaints. That meal kept me satiated long after I returned to Brooklyn and fell into deep sleep.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Tulcimex Corporation
"Her freshman year of college, my mother had her first bagel. My freshman year of college, I had my first bowl of pho. <br><br>I doubt any of my fellow dinners, all college student, presumably from NYU, were having any sort of first at Panya. The tables, piled high with school books and laptops, for assignments being delayed, seemed full of people who knew about Japanese food. There are dons, ramen and other meals here at this bakery/restaurant, which has a menu and quality of food larger than its interior might present. <br><br>While other places on this street might specialize in a single dish or two, here the menu is pretty varied and the results solid. My plate of oyako don contained no surprises, but this peasant dish of chicken, egg and onion isn't supposed to be comfort food. <br><br>Served with a bowl of miso soup and some pickled vegetables, the generous portion kept me fill long after my class and part of the next work day to boot.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Panya Bakery
"Shigure was quiet on Monday evening when I came with a friend from out of town. There were a few other people, mostly at the bar, but they kept their voices low out of respect for the space and the surroundings. <br><br>The space isn't huge, and dark shades of brown that cover the walls and booths make it seem even more quiet and small. It's a private cave where one can eat and drink in privacy. <br><br>As you might expect from an upscale sake bar in TriBeCa, the food and drink selection are well curated and generally excellent. Our sake, selected with the help of our server, was filled with the taste of fruit without being overly sweet.<br><br>The small plates are small but satisfying. We split some of the charcoal grilled shrimp, while I also had shio-koji fried chicken and duck cha-shu after my friend went off for other dinner plans. The duck cha shu was a particular revelation, as I'm not sure to the fattiness of the duck being prepared in the style of roast pork. <br><br>There may not be much buzz in this restaurant, either in or outside of the establishment, but it is very much worth getting excited about.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Shigure
"There's a ""To Go"" in the name of this restaurant so I don't feel bad judging it based on a Seamless delivery experience.<br><br>I ordered a two piece meal to accompany a late Friday night at the office, where I attempted to finish my list of tasks at the end of a long week. I was successful at getting work done, although not particularly thanks to this place. There's just so much more you can do with fried chicken, which could be crunchy or spicy or peppery or even all three. <br><br>The chicken that arrived from Dirty Bird just sort of sat there.  <br><br>Even worse was my side of ""rice and beans."" Was it my ignorance that made me thing I was going to get something like a spicy dirty rice? Either way, the slimy few beans I got on top of some dry rice were just terrible. <br><br>On Seamless, there are hundreds of restaurants available to order in just a few clicks of the mouse. I won't be making this choice again.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,2,Dirty Bird To Go
"Smokey Island Grille has a dim view of humanity. While most places believe the combination of shared societal values and basic decency will guide behavior through a public interaction, this place goes in a different direction. Nearly every inch of the wall and steam is covered in a maze of frequently CAPITALIZED signs, imploring customers to use hand gel, mind the different price points between parts of the buffet and what dishes are and are not available. <br><br>It's as if every piece of confusion or miscommunication in the past few years have been met with a new sign, in hopes that it will never happen again. It's a disparaging, demeaning way to treat customers. When stopping for food I felt constantly on edge that someone was going to leap out from behind the kitchen and yell at me for doing something wrong.<br><br>And even with all the signs, it was unclear to me that the in addition to the buffet there are jerk dinners and other Caribbean specialities behind the counter. <br><br>So many rules, so much aggravation. It's only worth it because of the large selection at the steam table, which was refilled twice during my visit to rotate in new dishes. And while it may be wasteful to have to split up a buffet order between dishes of different prices, it probably does give a person the ability to get more high volume items (like rice) without unnecessarily paying too much. <br><br>The mac and cheese was rich and dry, as it is in the islands, and the oxtail nice and tender. I do wish I wasn't on edge while eating it.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Smokey Island Grille
"Calle Dao seems a bit too proud (and wants to overly explain) its connection to the Chinese restauranteurs on the island of Cuba.<br><br>There's nothing particularly unique about the influx of Chinese immigrants to Havana, who wound up through restrictions and experience serving a blend of Chinese and local food from tiny stalls. This happened all over Latin America, from Nuevo Laredo to far southern Chile. <br><br>Cuban cuisine, however, stands out from other countries, so the combinations are different. And Calle Dao isn't incredibly interested in a slavish devotion to was actually served in generally quite basic establishments. I doubt before or after the revolution that many people were enjoying ""Peking-Style Cornish Hen in Banana Leaves"" on the malacon. <br><br>I had lunch here with a former boss, and we stuck to a mix of spring rolls and noodle dishes, each taking a Chinese and rolling in a few ingredients more associated with Caribbean food. Our waiter was attentive, the service prompt and the food just fine. <br><br>The dinner menu contains more complicated and interesting sounded recipes, so maybe that's where the magic happens, but my lunch was no better than the simple chifa I frequent in Williamsburg at double the price. This is Midtown, with its hordes of offices and people who head out of town in bridges and tunnels.

"If the Korean restaurants on 32nd Street can blend together on a walk down the street, each first or second floor palace looking like a homogeneous blend of barbecue and panchan, step back. There's a chasm between some of the dull takes on bibimbap and mandoo that some places provide and what's going on at Five Senses. <br><br>Five Senses has a signature dish - a mix of rice, kimchi, egg, a choice of meat and mozzarella cheese. All of the ingredients are mixed at the tabl and served on a sizzling stone plate. It sounds a bit unnerving - there is of course, not too much dairy in East Asian food generally - but in fact it's fantastic. The cheese fills in the cracks between the meat and the rice, creating a combination of flavors that is like an inverted version of a pizza. Or maybe it's lasagna. Whatever Italian specialty you prefer, it tastes like that, only better. <br><br>Flesh out the meal with superior takes on Korean foods easy to get elsewhere and those are a bit harder to find. There are scallion pancakes and jap chae, but also that same jap chae is available ""Busan Street style"" and there's a spicy stew filled with chicken wings. <br><br>All of this food is available around the clock, which almost seems unfair. How do the visitors to New York feel when they come too visit, and realize that they don't live in a place when this incredible food is literally always available? It really is a shame.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Five Senses
"I had Takumi on a drizzly Wednesday evening while exploring the fun fair attached to the bib signup for the AirBnb half marathon on Pier 2. That whole previous sentence seems like a Brooklyn hipster madlib, so I'll skip any swipes on the Japanese taco concept, as well, I frankly have no leg to stand on here. <br><br>I went with the Japanese curry nachos, which were a plate of bag chips with some sliced meat and cheese and napa cabbage on top. It was not well mixed, and the thickness of the gravy was hard to mix with the cold chips. The cheese was not totally melted, and didn't really enhance the dish. That cabbage was a nice bit of crunch - and something unexpected - but otherwise there were few pleasant surprises here.<br><br>This is food that has been designed to eat on the run and served outside of a traditional kitchen. This isn't a one time food event or unusual setup for the restaurant, so I'm surprised more effort hasn't been made to actually serving a product that tastes good as served. The curry lacked the deep flavor you see even at fast-casual places like Go! Go!

"The motto is ""good karma served daily,"" there are artful lightning fixtures and waving palm leaves on the website. Inday appears at first glance to be the insufferable apotheosis of our current twin obsessions with health eating and fast casual dining.<br><br>But on the way to give this place a pan, I actually sat down for lunch. It was relatively quick, it was casual, and the flavors were wonderful.<br><br>There are some kinks to the ordering process. Between having the explain this particular restaurants' take on the combination of proteins and vegetables and several of the Indian ingredients involved, it can feel like you need to pass a standardized test to get a meal. And well, it doesn't go particularly fast. Thankfully on my visit there were just a few customers (one actually gave up during ordering in frustration). <br><br>Please, stick with it! The food that arrives at the end, from the quinoa to the different kinds of rice, is high-end restaurant quality. I had a serious delicious piece of grilled salmon, with three kinds of chutney and vegetables. There's a tenacity to try to get you to have everything at once, but I'd love come back and sample different parts of the menu in isolation.  <br><br>I also washed this down with a very ice tea.

Be sure to grab plenty of red and yellow sauce (both are spicy and they are definitely not ketchup and mustard) for dipping and coating these beauties. <br><br>A couple notes - The kitchen isn't terribly fast as these are cooked fresh in a crowded space, so considered ducking inside if waiting on a rainy or cold day. There are a couple vegetarian options for the less fortunate among us who aren't able to enjoy these treats. <br><br>I hope the Amdo empire can expand to a second truck that makes it into Manhattan, so these can be more of a regular treat.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Amdo Kitchen
"Quarterly I lead a group of friends to different areas of the city, using our expanded numbers to eat through part of one of New York's amazing food enclaves. Recently we came to Jackson Heights, specifically to look into the growing numbers of Nepalese and Tibetan restaurants in the area. <br><br>Phayul was our first stop, and as a way of showing the difference between the filament lamps and exposed brick of our neighborhood eateries in Brooklyn and Manhattan, it was perfect. To get to the restaurant you pass a salon and navigate a narrow twisting staircase. A colorful pieces of drapery separates the restaurant from the public part of the building, but the lack of waiting area meant that my party spilled halfway down the stairs. <br><br>We were going elsewhere for momo, so I took advantage of the large menu at Phayul to try some dishes not always available at Tibetan restaurants. We ate shoo chaste and shook sit sit ngoe ma, both variations and potatoes and peppers with a strong spice attached. We had laphing, cold mung bean noodles related to dishes that come from Northeast China. We also sampled a piece of tingmo, the fluffy Tibetan bread served with proteins. <br><br>By the end of the meal, I was dealing with requests for butter tea. Despite my protestations that butter tea is awful and very much lives up to its odious reputation, a pot was ordered. Perhaps it was the ambience or the fact that true yak butter isn't available in Queens, but some members of my party actually seemed to enjoy it.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Phayul
"I find the professional breakfast to be a particularly harsh form of punishment, for it's difficult to be presentable in the best of circumstances before 9 a.m., but having to do without eating anything first is neigh impossible. <br><br>Now my meal at Dimes was only an internal get together, with a very nice person in town from London, but it still meant that certain things about the meal seemed magnified because of the hour. <br><br>We'll start with the extremely cold temperature, not helped by a swinging door which let air in without any protection whenever a new customer arrived. Nearly every patron was wearing their coat at the table, many (myself included) with a hat as well. <br><br>There was also our waiter, who I believe might sleep in some of colony located on another astral plane. He wore a sweater with several lovingly sewed patches in places with one dangling chain of an earning and serene expression that only comes from a serious amount of meditation. <br><br>We eventually made our way through the menu, a bewildering list of bowls and plates scattered with ingredients I associate more with clothing than edible food. My co-worker wound up with a bowl of strawberries, chia seed, some grain with hemp scattered on top. She gave up after a few bites. <br><br>The neurotic New Yorker and the excited Londoner aren't probably the best audience for this very Los Angeles of restaurants, but my entree of olives, feta, eggs, bulgur wheat, spinach and cilantro hit the healthful, flavorful mark. It was satisfying breakfast food without the grease of dinner classics. <br><br>It's weird and definitely not the typical scene, but it's open for breakfast and downtown at 9 a.m. and a pretty satisfying option.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Dimes
"Clearly this is a neighborhood favorite, for I had to wait a few minutes to get a free seat at 3 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon. This was on a only somewhat mild January day, when the wind blew across Prospect Park and threatened to interrupt the football games taking place on the now-brown meadows. <br><br>I have a small list of gripes from my experience - the service was very slow, the cashier absent for several minutes when I wanted to pay for my roll, the ATM was out of order and they slapped a $1 fee to pay by credit card. None of these errors were fatal, and the classic New York pizza with a bit of char and a nice cheese blend meant I got exactly what I wanted when looking for a neighborhood slice. <br><br>That's probably what's allowed this place to stay around for so long, and what will it allow to keep around long after I leave the city as well.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Smiling Pizza
"Joy Curry is solidly in an area of tourists and office buildings, but seems to offer a menu and product offering aimed squarely at Indian ex-pats and immigrants.<br><br>You can spot the difference almost immediately upon entering. Look closely at the variety of curries, that go beyond the typical chicken tikka and saag paneer. When I stopped in recently for lunch I had a fiery hot fish curry, something that would probably get few orders at the place closest to my office downtown. <br><br>It's an Indian equivalent to the New York gem of a block on 41st street between Madison and 5th Avenue that specializes in Japanese.<br><br>Not that this place is a secret. Office workers have rightly recognized the great food coming out of the kitchen, along with the fresh breads and vegetables. The express lunches at around $7 to $8, are nice portions sizes and a great deal. There are many places around giving far less and charging more far more. <br><br>Even better, since these dishes are designed to be pre-made and served warm, there's hardly a wait for such good food. There's also plenty of seating for those with more time.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Joy Curry & Tandoor
"New York, and especially downtown Manhattan, has very few ambitious Vietnamese restaurants. Choices are limited primarily to take-out driven places concentrated in Chinatown. While some of these are quite tasty, I welcome the chance to see what a more ambitious chef can do on a higher budget. <br><br>While billed at French-Vietnamese fusion, I'd say New American trends are the biggest influence in updating Vietnamese classics. The tastes of Vietnam are here, but sometimes in new formats. There are ca ri ga spring rolls and green papaya salads, and a variety of different proteins to serve on the bun. <br><br>There's a playfulness to the fusion, which reaches its apotheosis with the wonderful ""Vàch Kî rî spring roll. Those who have been to Vietnam will recognize just how almost-right this twist on words sounds.<br><br>All of this is in a bright but narrow space, with hanging upside down from the ceiling. It's a great option in the neighborhood, and if the food isn't quite earth-shattering, it is solid and better than another lame twist on an Italian bistro.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Bò Cà Phê
"If you're going to have a restaurant making burgers and fries, there's an expectation that both items will be to standard. This is hardly a tasting menu or a some Chinese takeaway with hundreds of options. There's really just two. And at this downtown Bareburger location, the fries aren't up to snuff. <br><br>Now perhaps I arrived too late in the evening or just towards the end of a batch of potatoes. But considering the premium prices one pays to dine at a Bareburger, that's not much an excuse. Soggy, crushed pieces of potatoes made me rue the couple hundred calories I consumed before giving up. <br><br>My burger fared better. I went with a custom creation, spicy mustard, raw onion and cheddar cheese on a potato roll. It was medium rare as requested, with plenty of pink juice oozing out of the center. I only wish I could mop up some of that melted fat with some fries. Not here.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Bareburger
"Not enough New York restaurants take advantage of their unusual spaces. <br><br>Mercato is crammed into a long, narrow space, nearly bifurcated by a bathroom and kitchen in the middle of the restaurant. Moving into and out of tables takes effort. Mercato has used its strange layout to create several semi-private dining spaces, from large booths to the tiny bar up front. <br><br>The high walls are lined with bric-a-bric, as if this is sheltering the collection of a long-dead Italian uncle. <br><br>The service comes the same comfortable space. A staff member sits next to me at the bar, while someone else takes turns refilling my water glass and delivering the meal. <br><br>My plate of potato gnocchi arrives just a few minutes after being ordered, with large chunks of pasta and a tangy ragu. I sop up the few bits of sauce with the free slices of bread, alternating that with provided oil dip. <br><br>Just a couple blocks from Times Square and its boring boxes, this place is pleasantly unconventional.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Mercato

Yes, there is soondoobu, but where are the spicy pork bowls and japchae?<br><br>Value at the steam table varies considerably, with the high price per ounce meaning that fruit and grains can be a particularly poor deal. The layout is strange, with some important drinks hidden in cooler that blocked by any sort of a line.<br><br>It's a bright space with an area to eat on the second floor, but as this very chain proves, there are better ways to do this sort of food.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,2,Essen Fast Slow Food
"I wonder if the rise of the Uber driver will mean the decline of New York's excellent watering holes aimed at the taxi driver crowd. Uber drivers own their cars and typically don't have the strange shift breaks and Manhattan-focused routes that lead to places like Lahori Kebab.<br><br>This restaurant definitely could survive by food alone, which includes a rotating list of daily specials along with large trays of vegetables and proteins. The combos are around $10 and come with a pleasantly crisp piece of naan bread (other subcontinental breads are also available).<br><br>The food is largely Pakistani, which means hearty flavors and none of the sweetness you'll see at places aimed at Americans on this block. Throw out the lame salad that comes with the dish and focus on the expertly done rice and generous meat portions. Make sure they give you a pitcher of water to deal with the copious spice. The frozen cooler is empty, the lighting industrial and the atmosphere minimal, which is exactly as it should be.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Lahori Kabab Restaurant
"For generations, Chinese chefs were chameleons. They adopted cooking techniques to local ingredients and flavor profiles. In America, this was chop suey and later sesame chicken. South of the border, it was arroz chaufa and tallarin salatado.<br><br>While the term ""chifa"" originated in Peru, it's come to represent a style of Chinese-Latin cooking that can be found form El Paso to the Tierra del Fuego. Having eaten at these places in Colombia, Peru and Chile, I was excited to see that fourth reincarnation of the Caridad space was the first proper chifa in North Brooklyn. <br><br>I love that there's a place consistently, perhaps even defiantly, making an investment in this area's Latino population at a time of accelerating gentrification. The menus are completely bilingual, and the clientele when I dined on a Saturday afternoon mostly Spanish speaking. <br><br>It still early, but there seemed to be more diners around than during the waning days of when this place served Puero Rican food. Chicken is still option here, but now it can also be mixed into fried rice. There are sides of planting for appetizers, also with crispy fried wontons. <br><br>I had chicken and peppers. The generous portion came with an egg roll divided in two and presented diagonally. The side was fried rice, mixed with what seemed like three kinds of pork and crispy lettuce.<br><br>This isn't the most refined food in the world, and it really does gain something but having positive associations for these dishes, but Caridiad is a great example of the form. Whether this is a first time eating these dishes or the 300th, this is a great place to do it.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Caridad China
"I wandered over to my colleague and fellow member of our intramural cornhole league. ""I left my wallet at that place where we had burgers last night,"" I said. It turned out his girlfriend had left her credit card behind the bar as well. And another member of our team did the same. <br><br>I sheepishly called Frites n Meats up. The waitresses who answered was the same person who served us the night before. ""My boss was wondering what happened,"" she said. ""He asked me what I did to you guys."" <br><br>I wish I could say it was the free shots, but some of us who left plastic in the bar avoided that hangover accelerant. I think it must have been the general atmosphere, which was funny and welcoming. <br><br>It was a cold Tuesday night, Fat Tuesday to be specific, so either the crowd was at home or at bigger parties. Even though it was quiet we felt welcome as we watched the New Hampshire returns roll in on a giant screen. <br><br>I've never been to the Frites'n'Meats cart, so I didn't really have expectations as I assembled a burger of BBQ sauce, a bit of bacon and raw onions. The Belgian-style fries - with complimentary sauce - were massively sized and perfectly crisp. Everything is ordered by pencil, which I always like because it ensures no mistakes in the ordering process. <br><br>Food came quickly, so did the drinks. And soon it was on to those free shots.

"When it was time for a group of professional friends to gather for an overdue reunion, we could have gone for the usual suspects, and waited weeks to into Keens or Peter Luger. Instead, we went for this Latin American-inflected option. <br><br>It was a good decision. I'll give three reasons why. <br><br>`1. Better sides. Although it's tempting just to eat as much as possible in protein, your digestive system is better with something else on the side. The workhorses of the American steakhouse, the fries, the potatoes, the steam vegetables, are almost always the nadir of the meal. Not here. The South American emphasis - this isn't really an accurate representation of a steakhouse in Argentina, Chile or any one Latin American country - means much bette options. Yuca and quinoa were great palate cleanser between bites of meat.<br><br>2. Better flavoring. I had the skirt steak, which came with a rich chimichurri sauce. This was one of the highlights of a week in Buenos Aires, and it's rather faithfully replicated here. With a bit of better, my medium-rare steak was an even tastier treat. <br><br>3. Less pretentious. Yes, the steak at Manhattan's famous steakhouses are good. But do they have to be such assholes about it? The warm service, neither intrusive nor inattentive, was a welcome accompaniment. <br><br>This wasn't the best steak of my life. (I had those in Argentina and Chile.)

"There are a few Smorgas Chefs around the City now, although the most important is located in the Scandinavia House just south of Grand Central. If a cultural institution devoted to the  Nordic countries is allowing this food to be served, who, as the Pope would say, are we to judge?<br><br>The somewhat lighter food of the far north is a welcome change from the heavy Mexican, barbecue, buger and German options scattered on this half of Stone Street. All of these places do have some sort of sad salad, but other than that it's typically meat and cheese on top of meat. <br><br>The gravlax came in a solid portion, with mustard and a cream dill on the side and a hard dark cracker for texture. The potato salad and crunch of the cucumber helped mix alternate the sour and savory bites in a pleasant way. My co-worker got the meatballs, which I suppose aren't light, but I've had in the past and do pass muster. <br><br>This isn't the absolutely high point of Nordic dining in the city, it's a bit too workaday and affordable to dive into the eccentricities of New Nordic cuisine, but it is a reliable and dependable option for when you want to eat outside not munch on a salad.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Smorgas Chef

Nothing really stands out here, except the service, which I found to be exceptionally friendly. There wasn't much of a crowd between the bar and the dining room.

We were seated right next to a box that operated the system, it jutted out in a way that one person was constantly on the verge of getting poked. <br><br>I suppose some people might find the perfunctory table side visits to be charming, but ours was so rehearsed, so uninterested in the actual diners that I thought it distracted from the  meal. The whole enterprise is curiously precious for a place that opened after I moved to the neighborhood. This isn't Peter Luger, where at least some of the snobbery can be defended in the name of upholding a tradition. <br><br>But whatever, the pizza is fantastic. We ordered one pie per person, which for a party of five is too many. We finished them anyway, reliving of ourselves of the need to eat again for the rest of that day and a good portion of the next. <br><br>The Hometown BBQ pizza with its sauce and hunks of meat was a particularly fiendish creation. Usually the toppings at these top-tier pizzerias are subtle and leavy. There's plenty of that here but it was real pleasure to see those protein pies on sale at mall foo courts elevated to the gourmet level. <br><br>The drink list could be better, I'm not sure who has room for dessert and again the music is too loud, but this is an absolutely unmissable place in North Brooklyn.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Paulie Gee’s

If that means you have to be ""in the know"" to find this place, all the better.<br><br>The gyoza, arriving in that stuck together style that's now taken over the city, are a great but unnecessary start to the meal. The bowl of noodles that arrives a few minutes after ordering isn't in the oversize dish of some places, but the broth is thick, noodle portion generous and meat fatty in a way that makes it hard to finish even without a first course. <br><br>And yes, you do need to add on ajitsuke, even if it means leaving some of the broth behind.

Normally the combined food allergies, vegetarian status, health concerns and generally preferences of such a large group lead to a compromise choice of something far safer and mundane. (See: the number of northern Italian restaurants with group seating.)<br><br>But we made it, a group of people where only a couple had been to China, and the experience of several around Sichuan food was ""spicy bean curd"" on a takeout menu.

Like so many of the places in Manhattan, definitely feel free to come in under the ""recommended"" serving sizes. This was especially true as we worked our way through the spinach salad, fried chicken and egg custard before (and during) the main course.<br><br>Devastatingly spicy, impressively accurate and totally unique in the New York dining scene, a dinner at the Mala Project will be memorable, no matter the size of the group.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,MáLà Project

The har gow wasn't overly doughy and the quality of the shrimp fresh and distinct.<br><br>I later read that there's a deliberateness to the throwback quality of the restaurant, and how the owner, with deep Cantonese roots is purposefully ignoring some modern conventions.

Certainly it would have been a feather in the cap of staying on top of the New York restaurant cuisine. I definitely bragged about it to friends and colleagues. Why yes, I had been to Fuku. Have you?<br><br>But I'm glad I waited, until after my second visit, with a few friends on a recent Tuesday. New York cycle of hype is so quick that the place was nearly deserted. A few people came and got sandwiches to go, yes, but those stools at the old Ko counter space were easily to acquire. The menu is a bit larger, with chicken fingers available along with some frozen drinks. <br><br>I heard a podcast recently that tried to match up New York's recent fried chicken sandwiches. They weren't terribly keen on Fuku's oversize fried patty of chicken. As someone who isn't usually too interested in a bun, I'm fine with the enhanced ratio. Large bus seem to hide the prize for me; they are empty calories on the way to the real flavor. The Koreano (with daikon instead of pickles; now on the actual menu and not a secret item) smartly cuts the spice with slight vingear flavor the radish.<br><br>This is the best version of the Chang potato wedge I've had, either at Fuku+ or here.

"There's a strand of revisionist of at least second-wave thinking when it comes to Sichuan cuisine in English writing. It's not all about the ""ma,"" the numbing sensation that comes from the Sichuan peppercorn that defines the cooking. No, it's all about the balance of flavors, of which spice is just a tiny part of this. <br><br>I'm hear to tell you that no one comes back from their first trip to Chengdu talking about the sweetness or saltiness in the dishes they tried. The fire, whether it comes from chili oil, peppercorns or dried chilis, are the most distinctive part of the cuisine of the province. <br><br>And presenting this flavor plays an outside determinant in whether a restaurant is creating a successful representation of the food here in the United States. <br><br>Which is a very roundabout way of saying the food at Famous Sichuan isn't spicy enough.<br><br>I ordered two workhorse dishes - wontons in chili oil and sold spiced noodles. Each of these are really street food in Sichuan and cost less than a dollar. Here I don't mind paying ten times the price - apartments are more expensive in Manhattan than Chengdu - but I do mind the tepid amount of chili oil, the over-reliance on sugar in the noodles and dryness of the meat inside the wonton.<br><br>The flavors are generally ""correct"" in that there they seem to be important, but the more aggressive overtones have been neutered. I'm sure a short conversation in Mandarin might convince the chef to go a bit heavier on the oil, but shouldn't a customer get a tasty dish as standard? <br><br>The restaurant's Chinese name is quite clever, as it literally would be ""Sichuan Outside Sichuan.""

It was $16, which was very fair. <br><br>I understand this is from the owner of the Bossa Nova Civic Club, and some of the preference for a reinvention of Art Deco-era nightlife is reflected in the decorating choices here. It also shares the sense of being slightly ahead of its time of this part of southwest Bushiwck. <br><br>But just as Bossa Nova has turned into a neighborhood institution for its queer-focused dance parties and embrace of the City's trap scene, I can see the demand for an upscale, yet reasonably price place for dinner and a cocktail or two.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Juno

So when reservations fell through later that evening for an Italian place, I went with a friend over to the better of the two tigers.

(I am sure there are better places to get wax in this city than the front of a restaurant.)<br><br>My friend recommended several dishes to try, but when arrived at 9 p.m. on a Saturday, the menu was full of crudely hand-drawn Xs. Five dishes on the not very long menu were no longer available. What at first seemed to be slightly aggravating was the sign of rapidly changing dishes and a commitment to serving fresh food to dinners. <br><br>Turns out it didn't matter, because what came out of the kitchen was some of the best food I've had in Brooklyn in months. The massive tiger prawns sat in a Thai sauce, pungent and spicy with each bite. The flavors on the menu incorporate the tastes of Asia (mostly Thailand and Korea) without being dogmatic about a particular arrangement or style. The cooking is very bold and very flavorful. <br><br>A bun we had earlier in the meal, a large soup my friend had, it was all fantastic. And while we ended the evening with some soju and another cocktail at White Tiger, I'm glad we wound up having our actual meal at Tygershark.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Tygershark
"Probably one of the only pizzerias in the city classy enough for a business line, Marta has thin, crisp pies and a slew of wonderful little antipasto. <br><br>We were a party of six, and with the slight encouragement of our waiter we went for six pies. We wandered our way through smoked meats, crisp vegetables and even some old fashioned cheese on the way to 1,000 calories or more. Before we got there was nice broccoli with chili flakes, chicken meatballs and other treats not exactly needed with the feast to come. <br><br>I'd been meaning to come here since this place opened, but it took nearly two years to get around to it. I wasn't disappointed. I will say this place looks bigger in photographs, so when coming a peak time a reservation is probably a good idea. For those who happen to be staying in the hotel, that's pretty good luck; this is a nice place.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Marta
"Driving through the streets of Queens, New York resembled upper Nepal more than ever before. We had waited an hour on the runway for the gate to be cleared, just the third flight in after the reopening of the airport. <br><br>The driver couldn't make it down the small side street off Broadway, so I did the last block on foot. I walked in the middle of the unplowed road and into this small store. It resembles a takeout Chinese operation that has been only slightly retrofitted to meet its new clientele. I stamped my inadequate sneakers to try and remove the snow, and ordered a plate of momo.<br><br>The atmosphere is communal, both by choice and necessity. Every other person in the restaurant was Nepali. They didn't seem to know each other, but the small tables were filled in by different people. Containers of chili were passed down, along with sections of a locally printed Nepalese newspaper. <br><br>My momo came, steaming and full of tender meat. Nearly everyone else had the thali. You see ""thali"" on menus around town, but a key part of the word has been lost to American dining practices. Here someone comes around with bowls of the main dishes, and you are allowed free refills of what you like. <br><br>Thalis aren't just American bento boxes, they are a way to sample a full meal and have seconds and thirds of the good stuff. It's just like going to someone's home, which Lali Guras pretty much is.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Lali Guras
"Bunn knows their audience, the people who are so pressed for time that don't even the 15 minutes it takes of the cafeteria style eats inside Food 32 proper. Instead Bunn is for people who need to do something that expert after expert tell us is a bad idea, yet we do it anyway - eat on the run. <br><br>I've been taking Russian classes around the corner (at a place that is an ESL classroom during the day, and foreign language institute by night) and sometimes there's not enough time before or after lessons for a proper meal. And Bunn does hit the spot when it comes to a snack. <br><br>One of their smartest additions has been traditional bao, which are here called ""pocked buns."" These come with a bit of spicy pork or beef, along with some cabbage. The spicy pork is a perfect four bite way to see off hunger for a couple hours.<br><br>The traditional bun/bunns require a bit of the nearby sauces to avoid being a rather flavorless protein bomb. This pretty much defeats the purpose of a grab and go food option. But this isn't really a place for a meal, so just stick to this when it comes to a snack.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Bunn
"The west size of Maria Hernandez Park tends to be a mostly Honduran strip, but there's always been a touch of Muslim influence in between the pupusas and cole slaw. <br><br>Now there's BK Jani, a Pakistani operation unlike any other in the city. The place is just a couple months old, but it's already covered with client testimonials about the quality of the food. There's much love for the ribs, but I went for the Pakistani burger.<br><br>There was no one around when I arrived, although a couple people joined throughout the meal. The space is mostly picnic tables, painted white and minimally decorated. There is no bathroom. The menu itself is sparse and written on a series of pieces of paper - it appears to still be evolving. <br><br>The Pakistani burger arrived more than 25 minutes later - these are cooked to order and it appears to take a fair amount of time. With really nice kick balanced out by a coolness of the raita, it really does manage to hit those spicier notes that you find in the western part of the subcontinent. I can't say I had anything like it over there, but the flavor mash-up seems right. <br><br>What's mashed and doesn't work is the potatoes that accompany this dish, which are just pieces of boiled potatoes broken into pieces and sprinkled with salt and spice. There's a reason why a burger isn't usually accompanied by a plain potato - it's pretty tasteless. <br><br>Great execution on the burger, slightly strange atmosphere and a need to improve the side options. Worth another look a few months down the road.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,BK JANI
"I'd passed this quiet looking spot many times while headed to the buzzier offerings on the other side of 9th street throughout the years. The sake bar, the okonomiyaki place, the burger place that opened in the booth where the okonomiyaki place used to be, the new location of the okonomiyaki place, and so on.<br><br>When I finally stopped to see the menu, I saw a soba-centered menu with lunch and dinner sets. I didn't mess around with my first visit, bringing a friend for lunch. I went with the cold soba noodles and dipping sauce. It's simple quality, nice and firm, with just enough oil coming from the sauce to add a bit of flavor.<br><br>For a place that struck me as quiet from the outside, there were plenty of people here on a Saturday for lunch, and I've read that waits aren't uncommon in the evenings. The crowd turns over fast so I doubt getting in would be too much of an issue. <br><br>Our waitress, Japanese of course, also gave my friend advice about avoiding soy for an upcoming trip to the Japan. She also guided her through soy and non-soy options for this particular meal as well, providing a lemon and salt glaze for her don.<br><br>I regret the portion size advice I gave to my friend. I told her to upgrade to a large don, as I assume things might be made for Japanese-sized bodies. It wound up being too much food for her. (Although I managed to finish all of the elements of my lunch set while feeling only slightly piggish.) Take that into advisement when going through the various options available.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Soba-ya
"Near the end of one of New York's most cacophonous blocks, there's a throughly mediocre kebab restaurant. <br><br>This is a place close enough to By Chloe that line sometimes extends near the door, near the dueling kati roll places and the future Pomme Frites re-location. A place run by Turkish people, people who I am sure know what a succulent doner or chicken out of the Sultanahmet should be. But, if they don't, here are some tips:<br><br>1. If you sell chicken and lamb, probably best not to actually have any lamb ready for ""15 to 20 minutes""<br>2. Why should kebabs take 20 minutes to prepare as well? These are always made to order and should take less than 10<br>3. Definitely be ready to serve things like manti, when they are on your menu<br>4. Do not serve ""turkish bread"" so chewy it disrespects the entire baking tradition of a great nation <br><br>Now the average doner in New York is worse than what you find in a European, let alone a Turkish city.

"Hype. Energy. Buzz. Excitement. <br><br>In restaurants, it usually comes with the opening. There are breathless profiles and reviews, competition among friends about the first to go, the hot takes and defenses. Then the TripAdvisor posts appear and so do the tourists from Amsterdam, Tokyo and East London. The second location and the new menu items. The chefs coming and going. <br><br>It's a steady drumbeat that burrows deep inside your ear canal. But as with all constant noises, after a while your brain deletes, it just fades into the background. There's a new noise, or in the case of New York 200 new noises, to capture your attention. <br><br>So it is with the Pok Pok empire, which arrived in New York four years ago to an avalanche of hype. First there was the ""pop up"" wing shop in the Lower East Side, but that was just a preview of the mini-empire that sprouted up on the Columbia Waterfront. At its height there were three different establishments in as many blocks, all turning out variations of a fiercely-spiced, aggressively funky approach to Thai food. <br><br>I know all this because I fell hard for the story. Part of it was penance for culinary sins committed in my youth, traveling extensively in Thailand but too often sticking to the ""banana pancake"" fare of bland food for tourists. It's really been in New York where I've discovered laab and kao soi, sour fish sauces and dry rubs.<br><br> Andy Ritcher represented the ne plus ultra of this, a man who spent years learning about these traditions, who filled his menus with paragraph long descriptions of the dishes and went back east with video cameras to meet local chefs. I've been to all of his restaurants in New York and even to a couple in Portland, absorbing his ethos and food. <br><br>But when I took a group of seven to Pok Pok Phat Thai on Wednesday, it'd been a long time since I'd even thought about the man. We are playing bocce in Brooklyn Bridge Park, and I was looking for a place to eat. I was hoping that we could sample Nashville Hot Chicken, the latest food trend to invade the city. It's not open yet, despite that steady drum of coverage and anticipation already beginning. So we went to Pok Pok.<br><br>It was empty. There was only one other person there at 8 p.m., flipping through a book on Thai history as she sipped a cocktail. The crowds had moved on. <br><br>What's left is perhaps the most approachable place in the Pok Pok empire. There's all of the ""hits"" and little of the challenging fare that scares people when they first see one of Andy's menus. <br><br>The menu is mostly chicken wings and pad thai. The pad thai is simply the best in the city. All of the sweetness and filler ingredients of the neighborhood places are gone, with the emphasis on a balance of flavors,the fish sauce and spice, the noodles and the protein. The wings are stellar as ever; it's no surprise that I've seen copies of this flavor profile showing up elsewhere in the City. <br><br>It's a shame that the people working here seem to have absorbed the knowledge that they are no longer working at the cutting edge of dining. The service was shockingly pokey for a place with no customers. Our waiter disappeared for long periods of time, took forever to arrive back some drinks and generally seemed disengaged. <br><br>Why should they feel like this? Pok Pok is still a worthy place to eat. Many of the people I came with had never had their food and were impressed. There are still so many minds to blow - let's not put all of our possessions on the hype train as it heads to the next station.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Pok Pok Phat Thai
"The wait is what you'd expect from a reasonably-priced Italian restaurant with a three star New York Times review in North Williamsburg - very, very long.<br><br>Reservations are scarce for non-verified Twitter users, single passport holders and people who aren't Pete Wells dopplegangers, so my part of two took our chances at a walk-in reservation. At 7:30 p.m. on a Wednesday, the quoted wait for two hours for the bar and no options for tables that evening. <br><br>Lilia is popular enough eschew the process that has made long waits at restaurants tolerable - calling when a reservation is ready. Instead visitors are forced to wait in a non-food serving back bar. The hostess did inform us we could leave and call back about our placement in line. We retreated to the Turkey's Nest, where one ""margarita"" meant stumbling back an hour later to Lilia, where our bar placement was ready far ahead of schedule. <br><br>Here we get to the food, which is a bit colored by the idea that I had some alcohol before arriving that was the quality of and strength of paint thinner. The first bite of the caco e pepe fritelle must have been what it felt like when the people in the back of the ""Snowpierecer"" train ate sushi after living off bar of compressed insects for years. We promptly ordered a second course. <br><br>Slightly harder to eat but still successful was the artichoke, presented like a opened lotus flower with breadcrumbs and garlic on top. I could have sucked every last bit of topping off these artichokes, but our main course arrived before that bit of desperation. <br><br>The malfadini looked amazing, a pasta version of the ribbon candies my Italian grandmother used to be serve the children on December evenings. There was butter and cheese mixed in with pink peppercorns. This unexpected bit of color and taste was ultimately a sour note, for the peppercorns overwhelmed the whole dish. Half as many would go twice as far here. <br><br>The crowds are endless, and while it may be tempted to sit out the self-perpetuating hype train around Lilia, there's the simple fact that the kitchen is serving some damn-fine food, buzz or no.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Lilia Cafe
"Let me clear up some things at Tortilleria Nixtamal - you are not the first person to journey from Brooklyn, Manhattan or even out of state to come here; most tortilla factories aren't like this, and there are many in the City; and this isn't the only place that offers this type of food in the area. <br><br>I, like many people, had heard about the tortilleria long before arriving. This is a place with hundreds more reviews than its surrounding restaurants, with plenty of good media coverage and long list of recommendations. <br><br>With my father, best friend and his son in town, I wanted to make sure we got a meal after the Mets' inevitable loss to the Phillies (they did lose). I originally planned to go somewhere else, but decided to switch it up after hearing that the tacos here are self-assembled from large plates of meat and vegetables. I figured the 4-year-old would enjoy this activity. <br><br>I was wrong. By the time we had explored the upper and lower decks of Citi Field, it was pretty clear that what this child needed was a long nap, not tacos. Despite ordering a very plain taco of chicken and a tortilla, he would have no bites of food. <br><br>Thankfully there were watermelon margaritas for the adults, with a spicy rim center and a fair amount of tequila inside. I had two. We also two of the platters, one with chicken tinga and the other served al pastor. There was plenty of food for the four of us, honestly we could have probably stuck to just one family sized platter. <br><br>The tacos are not as heavenly as their reputation. I suspect that people from the West and Southwest might be slightly disappointed after journeying out this far, for meat more tender and more flavorful can be found on the street corners of most towns throughout the country. The presentation is solid but not mindblowing, and it seems odd that this something of a right of passage for liberal New Yorkers. <br><br>Yes, these are better-than-average tacos, the interior is brightly decorated and the tortillas are made in house.

"The Bolivian Llama Party (stylized as LLAMA Party in person, perhaps to emphasize how you should feel after eating it) was tucked into a corner of the Brooklyn Shuffleboard Club. While waiting hours for our lane to open, my party of 12 or so decided to line our stomachs with some high carb fare ahead of a night of drinking. <br><br>Let's start with the fries - the fries were damp, cold and clearly past their serve-by time. There was some nice seasoning on time, but frankly there was no saving this turd. A couple members of our party had to wait about 10 minutes and were given fresher fries, but no one should be given what we were given. <br><br>The chola was much better. A gutbomb of multiple kinds of pork, cheese, onions and chiles, I imagine it as the perfect solution to staying energized at the high Bolivian altitudes. It also is O.K. to be served at different temperatures, which is key when dealing with the random crowds and demands of the shuffleboard life. <br><br>I hope the forthcoming Kickstarter and reopening will allow for better food across the board, because this is a solid idea.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Bolivian Llama Party
"​<br>Ramen is no longer rare downtown, but it's generally an undistinguished offering as part of a more modern take on the steam table.

There are a limited number of bowls of spicy chicken ramen, but these were long gone when I showed up for dinner.<br><br>Instead I went with a bowl of spicy pork ramen, which had a generous portion of spicy pork into addition to the soft, flavor-filled piece of char siu. It was a great bowl, even better because I wasn't expecting something so great.<br><br>I'm a bit torn between four and five stars, as Kuu is now undoubtedly one of the best downtown dining options.

"As my Uber crawled passed still undeveloped parts of the Greenpoint waterfront, I worried that I'd let my desire to go to the restaurant featured in that week's New York TImes restaurant review had let me to a poor decision. Choosing some place so far away from the L Train meant I had nearly 30 minutes to wait until my friend and dining companion arrived. <br><br>I spent most of it zealously guarding my extra bar stool, as those 30 minutes were the ones where Achilles Hell went from being a moderately crowded dining spot to hip bar. This is mentioned in the Times review, but I guess I didn't realize how quickly the vibe changes when you have a dozen young artists, writers or whoever lives around here standing next to you on the way to the bar. <br><br>My food came just as my friend arrived. There was a plate of spicy French sausage and a delicate arrangement of clams and vegetables in a small bowl. I would tried the rice balls as well, or perhaps jowl, but both had disappeared by the time I ordered. I find this a bit frustrating, especially at places like this one with short menus. I hope the increased focus can mean keeping items in stock into popular evenings. <br><br>The beer list is close to ideal, with a few surprises sitting inside some typical craft beer selections. It's a buck or two more than you pay at a bar around here, but the atmosphere on a winter's night, fireplace roaring in the middle of the dining room, makes up for the premium.  And perhaps by now the restaurant review followers have moved on to another establishment.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Achilles Heel
"This may be a bit like reviewing a Picasso by just looking at the upper right corner of the canvas, but I enjoyed the small bit of Wu's menu that I sampled on a recent visit. <br><br>I came in the middle of a bike ride, parking my Citi Bike on an early spring evening for a bite before heading to Brooklyn. This meant I was solo and not the hungriest person in the world, which meant I wasn't ready to sample the many Cantonese large format dishes (I saw someone getting a nice suckling pig delivered to the table) that dominate the dinner menu.<br><br>Instead I was able to get wontons with noodles and char siu, which is pretty much available for lunch. It took a suspiciously long time for this to arrive, but there were free peanuts and tea while I waiting. I suspect a reason for the wait was whatever dishes are needed for this entree aren't generally available at this time.<br><br>When I was served, it was worth. The wontons, with their mixture of pork and big chunks of shrimp, were among the best I've had in the city. It makes you realize how terrible a facisimile people are getting in the slimy, tiny ""wontons"" of American Chinese restaurants.

I'll stand around for long periods of time at dinner, but that's just not an option at midday.<br><br>I've been pretty much a soup guy here, as the sandwiches that look good have frighteningly high calorie counts and seem like they might induce a small coma to start the afternoon. I think the New York Clam Chowder is particularly excellent, and since it's a non-cream choice I sometimes opt for the larger size.

"I'd been meaning to try the breathlessly hyped Babu Ji since it opened. I was scared of the long lines and trying to drag people all the way over to Avenue B. Apparently people are better than me, because the crowds had made the journey in the winter several blocks from the subway. <br><br>A recent meeting out of the office meant I could plant myself in the East Village at 5:45 p.m. I went in and made a reservation with the waiter for 45 minutes later. It seemed silly at the time, as the just-opened restaurant had just a few people inside. But the hordes, of course, were coming, attracted by the positive notices in the New York Times and the viral kulfi pictures on Instagram.<br><br>A big part about what I didn't like about the place was the layout. The tables are jammed together, some of them at perpendicular angles. Navigating requires quite a bit of finesse, and it can even be a problem for some of the waiters. I was already pressed close to the table when one waiter asked me to slide in further so he could deliver a full tray of food. <br><br>The restaurant also has a beer fridge where you can grab drinks at any point in the meal. This would be fine except that it increases the flow of people wandering around an already crowded space. Also there's no bottle opener at the fridge so actually opening the beverage requires tracking someone down anyway. The selection is wide but uninspiring. Charging $8 for some of these cans is pretty darn cheeky. <br><br>The amuse bouche is one of the best things on the menu, a sweet twist on an Indian dessert that manages to delight. Some of the other changes and modifications are a bit more subtle, and mostly in presentation. This food is miles away from a takeout Indian food in Park Slope, but the overall experience can justify the hassle involved with dining.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Babu Ji

"Why eat here?<br><br>I get being seen at Tao. There's that incredible Buddha, that Eastern inflected house music that seamless flows from one song to another, those sweet yet strong cocktails. It's a place for the Gram, a place to show off to your friends in Ohio on Facebook or put in the back of a Snapchat filter.<br><br>But the primary activity here is eating and on that score, Tao falls woefully short. This is Asian food for people who think that Asia is a country. There's more sugar in these entrees than the entire kitchens of certain restaurants in Hunan province.<br><br>Let's review the some of the menu sections. We start with dim sum, a rather rigidly defined set of Cantonese small plates served in the morning. Here they just the first of two appetizer sections, including a Peking roll (from Beijing), a Chicken Gyoza (Japan) and Pork Spring Roll (Thailand). Not one of these dishes would be recognizable as dim sum, although all have certainly met the deep fryer .<br><br>Small plates include edamame, which is hard to screw up, a run of the mill salad and several items of seaweed. This are a large number of options, but ask for advice and waitress will helpfully push towards the wagyu. <br><br>For poultry, you have a condensed version of what is served at PF Changs: Crispy Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, a huge Peking Duck and something healthy called ""roasted thai Buddha chicken."" None of these are any good. <br><br>If for someone reason you find yourself here for a meal, steer towards the raw and simple. The sashimi is better than you might expect, and it's hard to go wrong with the self-cooked pieces of meat from the shabu shabu. Avoid the fried items, skip the dumplings and definitely stay away from the desserts. <br><br>The very worst part about Tao is the price. This food would still be bad if it was one-third the price, but it wouldn't be offensive. Instead I worry there might be dinners turned off from Chinese or Japanese food because they had to spend $11 on edamame, $14 on an egg roll or $30 for orange chicken. When you are spending more than $80 a person on a lunch that doesn't include alcohol or dessert, it needs to impress. <br><br>If you must, come in, snap a picture inside, and then walk over to someplace better.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,1,TAO
"Not only did the destruction of Penn Station remove a historic landmark from the City, it also left a huge section of Manhattan cursed with medicore fast food joints and awful options for the bridge and tunnel crowd. <br><br>While both the mayor and the governor are attempting some large-scale change, this restaurant this stepped in and started addressing the issue now. Pre-train food shouldn't be hard. People want a pint and some fried food before a long journey, especially in this age of no and/or limited food while onboard. <br><br>This being New York, I'd hope the beer could have some flavor and the food have a bit of a kick to justify the sure to be elevated prices. Haymaker succeeds on both counts. <br><br>There's a long draft list with good brews from near and far, which seem to hold plenty of surprises and limited run beers. The bartenders also know what they sell, and even can offer a bit of advice even in the middle of the Friday evening crunch. Even the chicken wings stood out, with their Thai-accented chili and garlic rub. <br><br>Quality meats, good hops and a great location. No wonder it was crowded on my visit.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Haymaker Bar and Kitchen
"We need our orders quickly, we told our waitress. We have a movie to catch.<br><br>Some places this would elicit an eye roll or perhaps a verbal lashing. Not at El Mitote. It meant we made it through a round of frozen margaritas, room temperature chips and chunky guacamole and thick, tortas dipped in chili sauce in around 20 minutes. And while we didn't quite make to the memorial showing of ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" on time, it wasn't the fault of the restaurant.<br><br>About those tortas. They are really were much better than you would expect in a neighborhood known for Rosa Mexicano and ""pre-opera"" meals. There was plenty of stringy cheese and brown beans mixed with protein and that spicy red salsa. If we had a few more minutes, I'm sure I would have lingered a bit more through the meal, and had a second margarita.<br><br>Thankfully they allow you to eat at your own pace here.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,El Mitote
"Entering an empty public space feels like a transgression. <br><br>Here is a beer hall, designed for mass merriment, but devoid of people. The last customer files out just a few minutes after we arrive on a Saturday evening. <br><br>I continue to be mystified by the traffic flow in Bushwick. A perfectly nice, new bar just above the Morgan L subway entrance is but the latest example. The previous night I went to Yours Sincerely, a draft cocktail place much further out than this place. It was packed. Perhaps because New York magazine hadn't written a blog post about the restaurant, the hordes didn't show up. Or perhaps things really get going later in the evening.<br><br>Whatever the case, the beer selection in here is varied enough to find something interesting, if not revolutionary. The bar snacks are greasy and heavy in an appealing way. My friend ate some fried pickles while I worked my way through a set of tatter tots. I was disappointed by the advertised shuffleboard table, which is not full size and has rather flimsy pucks. <br><br>I see on their Facebook page a commitment to innovation, including some N64 games, parties and a chicken sandwich and beer special. While the crowds aren't there now, with a bit of luck and the right promotion, I'm sure they will stop by.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Lantern Hall
"I recently decided to start learning Russian. I've been to the country four times and was sick of enjoying the food and culture without being able to communicate. <br><br>A couple weeks before these lessons started, I went to the Russian restaurant closest to my home. Now Russian food isn't as famous as Italian or French, or any of the other major European powers. But in this globalized age, I imagine there's room for an adventerous Brooklyn eater to add a few of the dishes in rotation.<br><br>From my expierence, this wouldn't exactly be true. I have tried and tried to get my friends to come over here. It's considered, or occasionally we stop by for one of their excellent distilled vodkas, but a full meal never seemed to happen. <br><br>Thankfully I brought someone here for a full meal. I munched through an order of pelmeni and with a pirozhok while sipping on a couple of meals. These dishes, like pretty much the entire menu, are Russian favorites. And the menu is long enough to get to things like herring in a fur coat and green borscht that aren't served at many of the standard places in Brighton Beach. <br><br>So I hope to return sooner rather than later. Perhaps when I do, I can order my next meal in a bit of Russian!",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Masha and The Bear
"For many years, my office celebrated the holidays with a lunch (boo) at Beckett's (double boo). After a change in leadership, I was able to work with our operations director to push for an early dinner (yay) at Distilled. <br><br>We weren't the only holiday party at the restaurant, this was clear in the way Distilled reorganized their menu into a mixture of small plates and large plates to create a three course set menu for the whole table. The highlight of the whole affair were those Korean-accented wings, along with the cauliflower and the topped popcorn. The main courses were a bit more ordinary, the bo bo chicken was a bit of a disappointment and the porgy just adequate. <br><br>We had a whole section to ourselves, which allowed for our Secret Santa and the conversation that happened before and during the eating to not disturb other dinners. And I didn't get around to writing about this until April for reasons unclear. It really was the best Christmas celebration the office has ever had.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Distilled
"George's is first and foremost a diner, so that means breakfast all day, fried plates and a long menu. <br><br>It's located in a primarily Hispanic neighborhood, so instead of the Greek specialities you might see elsewhere, there's a page of Mexican dishes. These are sold in platters, rather than the typical a la carte options, so there's no chance of getting away with a gut-busting amount of food.<br><br>I went with the chicken flautas, which arrived four to the order as opposed to the three pictures on the menu. They were only lightly fried and filled with nice chunks of chicken. There was none of the frankenfood I found a couple months a far less worthy (and not to be named) placed elsewhere in the area. I'm afraid the beans were a bit soft and both the yellow rice and the beans were lacking much flavor. <br><br>The dining room was half-full around noon on a Saturday, a mix between older men dining solo at the U-shaped counter and a couple larger groups of women in the dining room. For an area where many of the spaces can feel tired, George's is relatively recently remodeled, and its corner location means light shines in from three directions. <br><br>My waitress was friendly, even if her grasp of English and my grasp of Spanish are both limited. Be warned that when they scanned my card it didn't include a tip, so you have to leave something in cash.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,George’s Spanish and American Restaurant
"Our meeting ended at 11:15 a.m. in the morning. It was hardly lunch time, but I was determined not to pass up this opportunity to eat in a different part of town. <br><br>""Come on,"" I said to my two colleagues, ""I know a Jamaican truck just a couple blocks from here.""<br><br>Now when I worked on 42nd and Madison, it was a bit of a special treat to come over to Park Avenue and walk up towards Jamaican food. In the often less than hospitable Manhattan weather, it felt like a rather far trek to go there.<br><br>I wasn't sure of the exact cross street, but since we were starting on 57th Street and heading down, I thought it must be close.<br><br>My team flagged by 52nd street, were complaining by the time we reached the church and would have gone into open revolt if the Jamaican flag wasn't visible as we crossed into the 40s. Turns out this place was much closer than I remembered to Grand Central.<br><br>There's also the small fact that Jerk isn't the food truck I remembered from meals passed. I'm not sure if this is a descendant or completely unrelated truck, but it's pretty damn tasty none the less. I came back to the office with a massive amount of jerk chicken, some nice rice, and sometime later a small food coma because all the food I ate. <br><br>Thankfully it took a bit of a walk to get there.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Jerk Pan
"Last year there were a series of false alarms, overly optimistic Facebook posts and blown timetables about when the barge would actually arrive neighborhood. <br><br>By the time it came down the Hudson to Greenpoint, the weather had almost turned and my cadre of friends had turned our attention to something else. It would be another year before we actually cast off a few feet onto the water to this sea-borne bar. <br><br>I'm sorry I waited. The view - right next to Transmitter Park - is gorgeous. I'm reminded of the too-brief reign of the beach bar in Long Island City, or the too-brief view one gets from the Gondola to Roosevelt Island. Midtown, downtown and uptown are all visible, and on this particular evening, borderline breathtaking in the warm orange glows of the setting sun. <br><br>The beer selection is better than expected, and the bartenders were able to juggle to rather large crowd with aplomb. The food has to be ordered on land - a iPad system so you can order on the barge would be better - and is totally average. But it's not as expensive as it could be and I'm glad it's on offer in case a bite or two is needed. <br><br>The seas are generally calm except for when a large cruise ship passes by. Then everything shakes for a few seconds, a reminder that you've actually left land and are drinking with the fishes.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,The Brooklyn Barge - Temp. CLOSED
"A lot of hate for this lobster roll, most of which seems at odds with my three experiences at the place. There are a series of trucks around the city, but usually there's one parked near Broad Street in FiDi. <br><br>Service is surprisingly slow for a food truck operation. On my most recent visit, the staff was clearly struggling to deal with both online, takeover and walk up orders. That means that even a small line can mean a significant wait - much more so than other food trucks in the area. <br><br>When things are slower I've found the staff to be very friendly, and definitely about to example the different filling, side and topping options available here, which are extensive for a mobile operation. <br><br>I went up to the pretzel roll and no mayo option for a recent visit, which does push the price away from the bargain towards just fair at $18. But the increased meat count and nice bun means there's no need for any of the sides, which I thought were just fine when I've had them. <br><br>I found the flavor of the lobster to be one or two clicks below what's available at Luke's - still the city's gold standard - but still quite edible. Fix the line system and I could see this being a four star place.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Urban Lobster Shack
"It was the middle of the afternoon on Fourth of July, and I was just getting after a long morning of sleeping off the night before. I stumbled around Downtown Brooklyn, first in search of a Latin restaurant, then a diner and then a sushi place. They were all closed, either with reduced hours or a day off in honor of the holiday.<br><br>Forno Rosso takes no such breaks. They were open, with pleasing high ceilings and a slightly industrial feel. I went to the bar, had a couple of glasses of seltzer while chatting with the bartender. She was working just through the afternoon, before walking down the river to see the show. <br><br>I ordered a heaping bowl of gnocchi with pesto and sage, and then used most of the crunchy bread that came before it arrived to soak up the sauce. <br><br>""I assume you hated and want it to send it back,"" the bartender asked, refilling my seltzer and taking away the empty plate. If I thought that might been the ticket to another plate of this gnocchi, I might have actually played along.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Forno Rosso
"The Delaney brand carries quite a bit of weight.<br><br>Its first restaurant, the incomparable Brisketown, broke the traditional deli's dominance over the New York brisket scene. <br><br>A couple of pop-up places and event-only locations later, here is an entirely new concept, this time a take on the suddenly hot chicken sandwich. Here Delaney is following rather than pioneering, coming after a year when Fuku, Shake Shack and even the arrival of Chik Fil A have generated hundreds of conversations about the best way to place a piece of fried chicken on a bun. <br><br>Delaney has two basic variations - one with spicy mayo and cheese, the other with hot sauce and a pickle. I appreciated that they let me make my own version with cheese and hot sauce, avoiding both the pickle and mayo which I hate. <br><br>The crunch on the chicken is nice, although the sauce is a bit one note. Overall quite a nice sandwich - I would probably get this once a week if I was in the area. Unfortunately though this is not quite at city-best level. For that Fuku remains king.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Delaney Chicken - Vanderbilt
"Han Dynasty isn't the game-changing Chinese restaurant its fans from Philadelphia or the New York press will have you believe. It does successfully present elements of Hunan and Sichuan cuisine in ways not too frequently found on the island. But anyone who thinks they are getting the full Sichuan experience here at a bit mistaken. <br><br>I still recommend the restaurant, especially at lunch. The lunch-sized portions are perfect for business diners who won't be eating family style and the price point is shockingly low. I came with a couple clients who had a conference next door, who surprised me by taking me up on the offer to come here. <br><br>We started with some wontons in chili oil, which had nice skins, although disappointed on the spice front. I'm suspicious when this dish doesn't contain the fire hot that I'm used to Sichuan province or even other parts of China. I recognize that this doesn't meant the chef doesn't know how to prepare the dish, but it still seems somewhat off. <br><br>My main course was the cumin chicken, which works a set of spices into a pleasing dry rub dish. <br><br>Now there was a bit of a hiccup where one entree didn't appear until long, long after the after two portions. We inquired about this and our waiter sprung into action, delivering a free set of chicken wings when it became clear that the main course wouldn't be coming any time soon. I appreciated the gesture, which turned what could be a very awkward situation into something that just required a small laugh or two. <br><br>An upgrade over some other ""Sichuan"" options around town, but not the same as what you'll find in Flushing.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Han Dynasty
"The name isn't accurate. There doesn't appear to be a first breakfast shed and you can get food here long after night fall. <br><br>What you can get is a surprisingly long selection of Trini-style Chinese food, along with some of the island's traditional cuisine. For me, most Trini-Chinese dishes are too greasy and without much flavor, so I stuck to the other side of the menu. <br><br>I've seen photos of long lines here, but on my 9 p.m. Saturday night visit, there were no other diners. <br><br>I was able to assemble a plate of chickpeas, curry chicken and some cooked shrimp over a bed of rice for just over $10. It was too much food, but I made an effort. <br><br>I need to drop off a star for the state of the shrimp - they were small and tasted a bit rubbery. Their sauce almost made up for it, but this just wasn't the highest quality seafood. I have found memories from my time in Port of Spain of fish and shrimp, and it is disappointing to have it not taste the same here. <br><br>Service was friendly and accommodating - not always a given at a Caribbean restaurant I'm afraid - as they were able to explain all of the dishes currently on offer. There are quite a few Trini options in Flatbush, but this is one worth checking out.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Trini Breakfast Shed II
"The roti scene in Crown Heights is just so much better than the sporadically open, seatless and incredibly slow service operations just to the north in Bed-Sty. Exotic is a new-ish spot with a few tables, a friendly cook and an overall nice vibe. <br><br>The proteins vary by the day, of course, but I got a curry chicken buss up on a recent Sunday afternoon. It cost less than $6 and was far more than what one should eat in the middle of the day. I finished it anyway. <br><br>I got mine buss up, which has been a routine for me in the last year or so, since I learned what it actually meant. I always have a bit of a trepidation asking for roti this way, as it is surprisingly hard to say as a nearly middle-aged white man who is desperately trying to respect a culinary tradition without wandering into an overdone patois. <br><br>But here at Exotic, my request was met with a smile and a roti free of those weird little yellow dots that get everything in the default wrapper.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Exotic Roti Express
"A Chinese entrepreneur designing a restaurant that serves American-style food trying to absorb the Chinese-American and Korean-American influences of the neighborhood. <br><br>Uncle Sam's Burgers is more meta than self-indulgence alt-comedy set. Rather amazingly there's some halfway decent fare inside the concept.<br><br>I went for two meals inside a week, as I take Russian lessons across from the building. The layout is big, open and clearly inspired by other fast-casual restaurants like Shake Shack and Smash Burger. This wouldn't be so noticeable in Beijing, but here in New York it means there's a blandness to the surroundings that I'm not sure is entirely intended. <br><br>Kimchi is a great addition to the burger, if a bit of easy shorthand for Korean food. I'm not sure that my sandwich needed so much pickled radish. There's a reason why this is usually served on the side in Korean cooking. My Peking style chicken sandwich, which I had on another visit, was a more satifisying melange, with the thick hoisin sauce and cucumber adding crunch and texture to a nicely fried patty. <br><br>The fries aren't something to write home about and I hate that god damn Boylan soda that seems to be popping up more and more as places try to be ""upscale"" casual, but overall nowhere the trainwreck this place would seem to be on paper.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,3,Uncle Sam’s Burgers
"Maybe it's the bigger space, the larger menu, or just the neighborhood, but everything feels looser, and just more fun at Emmy Squared compared to the original Emily. <br><br>Emily makes great thin pies, with precise toppings, but the dimly lit and crowded exterior, along with the strict no substitution policy and rationed number of burgers meant that eating there felt like a privilege rather than a choice. <br><br>Working out of a corner slot that briefing and disastrously hosted another burger restaurant last year, Emmy pushes a slightly different concept to even better results.<br><br>I knew things were going to be good when I showed up to find the rest of my family already seated (a rare treat these days, especially at a hip restaurant) and speaking with Emily herself. I was able to catch the end of the conversation, where Emily joked with my namesake sister and  even explained that a downstairs space meant that there would be more burgers and no limits down there. <br><br>We ordered a mix of (and too much) pizza, which were heavy and rich but also pumped full of spicy and tangy notes. This had the richness that you see in the middle of the country with the flavor that can be forgotten. We also ordered a meatball sub as an ""appetizer"" - this was a gluttonous meal - and it was exemplary done. <br><br>Who knows if this is exactly how they serve pizza in Detroit - not I. It is really, however, excellent stuff.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,5,Emmy Squared
"This is a great bar. If I lived closer I would be coming here every week, as it stands it's more of an every other month sort of affair. <br><br>As a restaurant, it's a bit odd. The bar food is fine for a snack, but assembling a full meal means you have to be really into exact what they have, or go for the one or two more substantial plates. <br><br>What's on offer is high quality and artfully presented. When I'm not too hungry, a nice cheese place and a couple pints is a fine way to spend a couple hours. <br><br>Also great are the many kitchen pop-ups that are here, which can be a madhouse but can also be a way to catch a chef or restaurant doing something experimental or just really good. Nice trivia night as well.",Ja9gBg4CYOne-MXqHUrcYA,4,Humboldt and Jackson
