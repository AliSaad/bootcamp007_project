Good quality fresh produce for cheap! I'll be bathing suit ready in no time!,RtqvyG-gXSnHAID81BQVyA,5,To The World Farm
"The only place to get the freshest, cheapest produce in the area.  I did a price comparison with Key Foods, which is down the street, and the same amount of fruits and vegetables were nearly half the price at To the World Farm!  Everyone there is incredibly nice and helpful. Not to mention, their selection of fruits and vegetables is fantastic.  Poblano peppers, fresh herbs, even mustard greens!  Two different types of mangoes!  Italian eggplants! Tomatillos! woot.",swjMOyGRALYs_rJLoi4qng,5,To The World Farm
"I just returned from this delightful place, and I am officially never getting produce anywhere else. I love that I can get all my necessities for the next two weeks, splurge on delicious peaches and nectarines, and the total is still only 22 dollars. We're talking a lot of produce here, people. Dropping all these extra pounds is going to be so much easier with this place in the neighborhood, thank you!!",XnMKnhwYADo01Y6DzaLpOQ,5,To The World Farm
"Yeah, I don't really want to shop anywhere else for produce ever again. So much love for this little healthy heaven.",Rm6BAksEwkQEZD_f1_6dpg,5,To The World Farm
This place rules! The produce is fresh and the prices are mad reasonable. I think it's a family run operation and everybody that works here is very friendly. The selection of fruits and herbs are off the chain. This place is a godsend for someone that cooks as much as I do.,CYd9M0nM9V8GGX3b48jAMA,5,To The World Farm
"I just moved to NYC, and I stumbled upon this market online, decided to try it out on a whim because I didn't feel like slitting open my pocketbook at Whole Foods. <br>This place is awesome! For under 30 dollars I bought: Fennel bulb, green leaf lettuce head, 1 bunch beets,  thyme, parsley, mint, 16 oz can of Kimchi, Sushinori, bag of radishes, 3 eggplant, 1 bunch carrots, 3 lemon, 6 lime, seven peppers asst. and a box o' concord grapes. Everything was fresh and beautiful. The only downfall is they don't have any meats or fish - just beautiful veggies, goya canned goods, and a small selection of beer and juices.",PCtl2znQ2-EB6utB4ypJTA,5,To The World Farm
"everything is so fresh and so cheap!<br>fantastic selection of fruit, vegetables, and fresh herbs.<br>they've also got a great selection of harder to find specific produce.<br>(jamaica peppers, italian plums, lychee, etc.)<br>they always have fresh made kim chi in the back fridge section.<br>everybody here is super nice and it's soooo easy on your wallet.<br>i buy all of my produce here as long as i can catch them before they close at 7.",GGNEgde_k55oyzKNcBHMAw,5,To The World Farm
"I LOVE this place. I wish it was closer to my apartment! It is the only place I ever want to buy produce from anymore. The prices and quality are unbeatable, and like everyone else here mentioned, the staff is also incredibly friendly.",A9AR-vKvFecg6sX4eLoR8Q,5,To The World Farm
"Unfortunately, I think prices have gone up to equal or just under some local Williamsburg supermarkets.  I hope not since it is/was such a pleasure to shop here.  I recall it being a greater bargain as others have noted.   It's a little trek for me on my bike but I will definitely go back one more time. They are very friendly and hope it was an aberration based on the produce I got.  Will amend after I go back, if necessary.  Regardless, the produce is very good.",IJthSIoHO9pN-rIKWThCOA,3,To The World Farm
Great prices. Nothing compares to it in the area,tPCF1DhAiWFldNYJecwpyg,4,To The World Farm
"Great produce at amazing prices. Every interaction I've had with the staff has been really pleasant, too. <br><br>I feel very fortunate to live nearby!",U3reM_vdKn7smzSxx-zS6Q,5,To The World Farm
"Really good produce place. Low prices and a nice selection of produce. They've got your standard fruits and veggies as well as some harder to find exotics? Tropicals? Anyway, good staff, good produce, good prices.",CI26nb8VxbA5iwQGKs8Iww,5,To The World Farm
"My friend I was living with introduced me to this green grocer my first week of living here, and honestly it doesn't get any better than this. The produce is SO FREAKING CHEAP, cheaper than Publix produce ($1.25 for a huge head of red leaf lettuce?!?!?! You gotta be kidding me!) and its super cheap and delicious. I don't go anywhere else for produce.",oyRJbRWT70Cy4t7qGGG1gQ,5,To The World Farm
This place is great... I bought an on the vine tomato from here today that was so perfect it was enlightening... oh and $1/lb instead of the usual 3-4.  I mean if you like getting better produce for cheaper this is your spot.  I just can't wait for some jacka$$ to give this place a 4-star review saying he really like it so I can send him a message about how he doesn't know the meaning of life.,WRSedlpmhA-9ZqVMUFtPMQ,5,To The World Farm
"Such a gem in Williamsburg and NYC in general, where usually the produce is expensive and the staff rude, this store is staffed with really helpful and kind staff with amazing prices.",k8Ota_VDHtNe38pnMaYTww,5,To The World Farm
Lots of fresh produce &amp; cheap!,ZL-bhS3p1bnKqfR2-YtadQ,5,To The World Farm
"This place is good enough that I will cite it in ads trying to find roommates. The people who work there are nice. The produce is good, the prices are better. Especially on herbs.",odSdXIXaeEZepF0e5lR54w,5,To The World Farm
"This place is great! The food is really cheap and good. Everyone that works there is so pleasant and accommodating, I go out of my way to go here for produce.",4ptVtPgEDDTPuSpp2J66fw,5,To The World Farm
"I love this place. Great prices, selection, and probably the coolest and friendliest store owners around. You have to find what's freshest like any market, whether it be whole foods or key foods, but this place takes the win. They've even done shopping for me when I needed a case of ripe avocados. They regularly have blood oranges, and they have the best hot Italian peppers. And I get out every time for under 20 bucks and a ton of veggies. Love this place.",lZ3EzQypsUlF0ce_S58wqg,5,To The World Farm
"Awesome prices, awesome variety! So glad I came across this place and I can't even get over it!",joQ-ug_lBkfAbAsejQN8eg,5,To The World Farm
"The produce is fresh and cheap. The staff, including the black and white<br> kitty sleeping in the basket under the tofu, are all friendly and sweet. I've heard the guy who works in the evening speaks seven languages and I believe it. <br>It's the only place I go to in the neighborhood for fruits and veggies.",-uqnlNWprOZJNxe9kDGm-Q,5,To The World Farm
"Having moved to East Williamsburg from Greenpoint, I found myself sorely missing the various low cost farms competing with each other on Manhattan Ave. and Nassau. Finally, having found To The World Farm, I have been able to free myself from the tyranny of lackluster produce at Ctown and the criminal gouging at Khim's Millenium Market.",jC-QErzSv9-nsysetS1n9w,5,To The World Farm
"5 stars for this place based on price/value and friendliness.  Veggies here are so cheap comparatively and are of equal or better quality than most other places in the neighborhood.  Of course, Whole Foods' organic and exotic fruit selection can trump this place, but that is a different, high-end ball game.  Bring your fruit selection skills and you will eat well, inexpensively.",6fsfeYpgsnEOY8P1V9WMqw,5,To The World Farm
Cheap prices. Fresh produce and wide selection of fruits/veggies. 3 min bike ride from my apt. YES.  I will be buying a many things - ruining them in my learning how to cook attempts (my pasta with zucchini was a mini disaster) BUT at least they won't break the bank.,BYvjvN7Wgxbhd9ZvDRIlUg,5,To The World Farm
"This place is great! VERY friendly staff, great prices, and great produce. They do not carry organic products regularly, however, which is understandable given the neighborhood. The owners must pay a lot of attention to the quality of the produce, buying things in-season so the flavors are at their best. I recommend paying with cash as well, this seems like the most efficient way through the line.",lZsALT-ZHBUHyXtICVOb2A,5,To The World Farm
"Super super friendly staff. Great prices, really good selection for Brooklyn. Been keeping my grocery list healthy and cheap for 2 years and I love them for that.",p_TlU44BwBzS29BeqjujdA,5,To The World Farm
"I'm new to the neighborhood and this place is awesome. Super cheap, and the girl at the checkout says all the prices of everything clearly- not that it would matter because everything's super cheap. Good quality produce, and you can get older or bruised stuff packaged up even cheaper in a small section in the back. They have everything. And a cute cat to boot!",qMLiQrGlMlPqR9eeLJsA4w,5,To The World Farm
"Cheap, fresh veg; wonderfully friendly people. half the price of buying veg at an overpriced health food deli. They have a huge selection, including fresh herbs ($1 for fresh lemongrass, basil, rosemary, mint, 4 or 5 others), 5 kinds of bulk mushrooms, korean sweet potatoes, 10-12 different kinds of greens, etc.",La3eyIIp7iuTaLfIfMvwmg,5,To The World Farm
Great little grocer when it comes to produce.,8RcEwGrFIgkt9WQ35E6SnQ,5,To The World Farm
"Best grocery store for fresh produce in the area, excellent customer service and you cannot beat their prices &amp; quality for fresh juice!!!",bx7bCjbkeVx1kgnaW5xL2A,5,To The World Farm
Everything is super fresh and the everyone working here are very helpful. Really recommend the fresh juices. Plus you cant beat the prices here. super cheap.,16BMtkE8CAjV_AXfJyI4vg,5,To The World Farm

"Great place nice people. They have good juice, cheap produce. They all speak Spanish which is bueno for me.",etqPZO8uHNBUIE2Pv6pWmg,5,To The World Farm
"Great produce, great prices, great people. Have a little juice bar which is great to grab on the go.  Highly recommend that you stop by!  <br><br>it is small however so you won't have a huge selection to choose from but what they have is very fresh and well priced",L0FopEHRvcV2TfFXdPynlA,5,To The World Farm
Their juices are delicious and well prepared in front of you. Typical freshies &amp; herbs . Pineapples kinda over ripe but doable at a moments notice. Nice place to try out. I will be back when in the area for sure.,X1hsQqbL5YQlClmWOnktAA,4,To The World Farm
"This place is really perfect! Produce at affordable prices and great quality! They also have a juice bar where they will juice whatever you'd like, and the price is by cup size rather than what goes in it. Definitely a gem!",WpEdypbKppaSwAv8yKM7zg,5,To The World Farm
"I now always buy produce here. <br>Good selection, good prices (have gotten a little more expensive in the last year but then again this is Williamsburg) and a helpful, friendly atmosphere. <br>Not organic, but then again not waxy supermarket produce. <br>I like how it feels like a semi-indoor farmers market too. There's no room to move around but that's ok because it's a neighborhood spot, and everyone shopping respects that about this place.<br>I definitely recommend shopping here!",MxZKXnVBYu9QWVdxsNkhVA,4,To The World Farm
"inexpensive, great for a lot of last minute items you forgot to buy at your usual grocery store (fruits/veggies, spices, snacks), and really amazing prices for fresh juices and wheatgrass. customer service also always very friendly. let's please keep this place in business.",CcntZ9Udh1W73Jwae8_6Kw,5,To The World Farm
"I love this place. They have a wide selection of fresh fruits and vegetables that are available all year round. They have great prices, so you can get more for your dollar compared to the grocery stores in the area. <br><br>The people who run the store are very helpful and kind. My only issue with the store is that it's very small and cramped and the aisles are extremely narrow. But I'll deal with squeezing through the aisles for the cheapest and freshest produce in the area.",aeUjcYGDXTyud3DAATJWTQ,5,To The World Farm
Nice fruit store with wide variety of fruits and vegetables.,lhaMqw9evH_D3SDVdI9s8Q,4,To The World Farm
"Best priced produce in Williamsburg with a friendly staff. A lot of variety, I'm never unsatisfied.",88uMTKsdJVPB3pClD9Y0zg,5,To The World Farm
"Good produce at good prices and that sums it up.  The staff are nice and they have a huge variety, much more than other places in the area.  Also they have some asian items that you can't find anywhere in the area. Well worth the walk to get there, walk right past the super market and it's right there.  I always come away with something delicious that I did not intend on getting.",ucP2NOBCT5j-q1X1NBFXvQ,4,To The World Farm
"They have everything! Fresh herbs, Korean sweet potatoes, Korean peppers, leafy greens, variety of mushrooms, tofu, fresh fruit, and the list goes on! Very clean and organized. The staff is super friendly and attentive! Not your typical grocery store. What a gem!!!",UX9gSCq5SOVjGB9pKrd_HA,5,To The World Farm
"Great fresh produce, great prices. Also, corn tortillas that we're made on the same street for $1.40? Beautiful.<br><br>Also, friendly service as usual. Love this place.",iBlkvjh0R-704pAN3al_lg,5,To The World Farm
"So much food.  So cheap.  So fresh.  Please go here.  $25 = lettuce, blueberries, strawberries, grapes, 3 peaches, a mango, carrots, cucumbers, potatoes, plums, an avocado, a tomato, a quarter watermelon, and tortilla chips.  So much food for so little, especially for New York!",CXmoa4xbx08ncDy74btgIg,5,To The World Farm
"This market is unbelievable and I would encourage anyone who appreciates fresh produce, excellent service, and stretching their dollar further to join the ranks of the regulars. I'm going to jump on the shopping list bandwagon and let you all know what I got for $25: six bunches of miscellaneous greens, two large cucumbers, two blocks of tofu, a bottle of apple cider vinegar, a wedge of cheese, two large cucumbers, two red bell peppers, a punnet of blueberries, a pound of cherries, a bunch of celery, a bunch of spring onions and five limes. It's a brilliant, family-run business and it's very deserving of your patronage! Reward yourself by paying To the World Farm a visit.",-6AQZqWU9bJdaGkYOX89xA,5,To The World Farm
"Don't believe the reviews? 4 bunches of kale, 2 spinach, 5 carrots, 4 beets, 3 apples, parsley, mint, 2 cucumbers, 3 peaches, half a melon, and celery = $20. Yep, twenty bucks. Make the trip. Definitely worth it.",TOTEJfWZp69RFhGOPSvOpA,5,To The World Farm
The ONLY place to get fresh produce in East Williamsburg. Much cheaper than Key or Associated - worth walking that extra block.,3a53mqdG9xEedE84u1AigA,5,To The World Farm
"This place is just phenomenal. Super fresh, super cheap produce. I've walked out with two completely full grocery bags of fresh fruits and veggies for under $20. Raspberries/blackberries are often $1.99 for a container that goes for $4.99 at my local supermarket. Selection is also great, they stock everything from fresh mangos to fresh tarragon. <br><br>The people working there are also really friendly and helpful. There's even a juice bar where you can order juice and watch them make it fresh. A real neighborhood gem!",CHA5zG0vvDJi6dzVMImZxQ,5,To The World Farm
"Ok I had high expectations... And they were somewhat met. I was extremely excited and drove 20 minutes out to do some grocery shopping and get some juice after a day at the gym. The prices are pretty good but I guess I'm just really blessed to live in Queens because they were still pretty steep. <br><br>However, they won me over with their amazing customer service, overall pleasant attitude and smiles, and also their selection. Kaffir leaves? Thai basil? Home made ricotta? That was awesome and definitely worth the buy if I needed it. <br><br>The juice bar on the other hand is super awesome and worth the $4.00 for the 16oz drink. I had a hard time choosing from the pre-written menu but thanks to a fellow customer in front of me, I found out that you can customize your drinks!!! (As long as your reasonable). So I got the summer mojito and added some kiwi and bam I was sold. <br><br>I'll be coming here solely for the juice if need be: refreshing and reasonably priced, what else can you ask for!",-_zMvzERW9bt3wY-BXGfIA,5,To The World Farm
"I am obsessed with this place! The day they opened their juice bar was one of the best days! I love that I can go here and find the freshest produce at the best prices, and get a fresh juice with prices that are less than half of what I'd pay anywhere else! And they're far more customizable and made with care than anywhere else!",W7tyItw7u--IuhNr8yfTtA,5,To The World Farm

"This awesome market has a lot of variety and I was super excited to walk in and check everything out.

I will definitely be returning as a frequent customer!",RzHeGemieN0x7_SoXLOC_g,5,To The World Farm
"Inexpensive, wide selection, and cats.<br><br>What more could you possibly want in a basic grocery store?<br><br>Fresh juice for $5. Least expensive price I've seen in the area. Highly recommend this place for your groceries. Side note: they do close relatively early, that is the one downside. I believe they are open weeknight til 7:30-8.",63RMC0LxibWFTlHOGgseGw,5,To The World Farm
"Very reasonably priced produce and a super helpful and good-natured staff. This place really exemplifies why mom and pop grocery stores deserve our business over big impersonal supermarkets. Such a difference from the local supermarkets where produce is a rip-off, there is no one to help you and the check out girl growls at you. I always feel great walking out of this store.<br><br>This place is 10 blocks from my house but I always go out of my way to come here. I recommend this place to everyone.",j9VCSw8r-vSqB6gw0XURDQ,5,To The World Farm
"**THEY EXTENDED THEIR SUNDAY CLOSING HOURS TO 7:30PM**<br><br>came in based on reviews and was NOT disappointed.

"I just wanted to update my review to add that this has become my favorite grocery store in the neighborhood; I go 20 minutes out of my way to buy groceries here because the selection, service, and prices are great.

"Phenomenal produce place with a great juice bar. EVERYTHING here is SO cheap for the area. It's a lifesaver. I'll come in here once a week and spend about $25 on all the produce for the week... probably would cost $40 at a similar grocery or a corner store in my neighborhood.<br><br>In fact I make a special subway trip here because I can't fathom supporting any other business as price gouging is what it is in Williamsburg. <br><br>As well as having consistently great quality and great-priced produce, the owners are SUPER friendly and warm and welcoming. Asian immigrants are known as being hard-working for good reason, but it's not every day you see a group of people entrepreneurial enough to learn a THIRD language (Spanish) to communicate with their clientele (the neighborhood, though increasingly gentrified, was Latino for decades before it became the zoo it is now). There's nothing cuter than seeing the store owner, a 50-YO woman who I believe is Korean, chirping away in Spanish with an older Puerto Ricana! Warms my heart, seriously.<br><br>Juicebar reco: watermelon / cucumber / mint / ginger / THAT'S IT<br><br>Thank you To the World Farm for saving my wallet and stocking my kitchen!",-i1lT5CQIwQp_ui00sX1TQ,5,To The World Farm
"Very very happy to add another 5-star review for this place!<br>I discovered this place today on my way out the house, and I'm so glad I found it! I was lured in by the cheap prices and amazing looking fruit, and ended up buying enough groceries to last me all week for under $20. The selection is unbeatable and the cheap prices seem too good to be true. They have everything you can think of, more, and to top it all off the staff is extremely happy and kind. A big container of homemade kimchi for $3. Tofu by the lb. Fresh fresh produce all around.<br><br>I could individually distinguish the taste of all the fruits and vegetables in my freshly squeezed $4 juice, and I had a lovely chat with the lady while she made it. Amazing.",uotPtu948VALXSIlqTdUlQ,5,To The World Farm
"There's always a long line for the juices here but they're so worth the wait. They're cheap, cups are large and if they make a little extra you're encouraged to take a sip from your cup so that you can have the remainder. Oh, and the staff here are super friendly! Third time here this week..keep my juices coming! :)",GzjO23BRWh88VmWhePVBLw,4,To The World Farm
