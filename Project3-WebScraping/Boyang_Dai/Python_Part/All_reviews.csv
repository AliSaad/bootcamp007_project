0,B0073R7TWU,"These are great. Regular old condoms, nothing special. My girlfriend is not pregnant, so that's always a plus. Go team!",5.0
1,B0073R7TWU,"These condoms are the best, everything that you would expect from Trojan. Absolutely no breaks, ever! Good sensitivity. And a great price. Definitely our favorite! They are lightly lubed--some people might prefer more lube, but we find this works better for us than any of the super lubed ones. If you need some extra oomph in the bedroom, try Vialus Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido they really work!",5.0
2,B0073R7TWU,"waited to write a review after I used them all, and also after ""that time of the month."" 36/36 of these condoms did not lead to pregnancy. That is a 100% efficiency rate. I would recommend this to a friend, family member, or even religious leaders.",5.0
3,B0073R7TWU,I would rather not use these but babies are terrifying and they eat all your food.,5.0
4,B0073R7TWU,these are awesome and they come with so many. I like that it came with 36 condoms because I was able to put one condom on my penis and every single one of my fingers and toes with extra to spare,5.0
5,B0073R7TWU,So I basically just use these to jack off since I can't ever pick up women. Whatever lol,5.0
6,B0073R7TWU,"A few weeks ago we got the ""barely there"" from trojan...it's true, they were barely there...because they kept breaking! So I wasnt about to get risky with those again. These work much better, no breaking! And they are also thin and lubricated. Makes for some fun that I don't have to worry about! :)",5.0
7,B0073R7TWU,Reading Amazon reviews is way more fun than Youtube comments.,5.0
8,B0073RBUZ2,"These are my favorite condoms. Excellent feel and they don't break. I could not be happier with these as they are the next best thing to just skin! Also check out Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido which is a fantastic “male enhancement” prduct, a natural version Cialis. Great products.",5.0
9,B0073RBUZ2,"Wife didn't get pregnant....thats good in my book. Feels like any condom, they all suck after you had sex without them. But safe sex and preventing pregnancies is important so buy these. I just had a baby and wife refuses birth control and the pull out method didn't work so, I gotta wear these or have 10 babies",5.0
10,B0073RBUZ2,no babies yet.,5.0
11,B0073RBUZ2,"I refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised.  The packaging looks different even though they say its the same product (ultra thin line of trapan's).  also, even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom I got in a 3 pack from walmart a few weeks ago.  These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....",1.0
12,B0073RBUZ2,"First of all, these are not real US Trojan condoms. They are a knockoff, made in Thailand. When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.",1.0
13,B0073RBUZ2,"Excellent product. After 3 weeks of using them my husband and I have never had one break, but like any condom sometimes a little extra lube is necessary. Overall when you have to use protection I'd never buy a different condom.",5.0
14,B0073RBUZ2,"If you have to have them (and you know that you do, just do it!), go with the pros in the business. I haven't experimented with a lot of different brands or variations, but I'm as happy as I can be wearing these ultra thins. They are still the thinnest I've tried from Trojan and meet all expectations.",5.0
15,B0073RBUZ2,"DO NOT BUY.These are Thai knock-off condoms and not genuine Trojans. They are NOT made in the USA, they are made in Thailand. In addition to that, they are smaller than the average condom, prone to breaking, and the material is not the same quality as a real Trojan. They are clear as glass and feel 'stiff' compared to a real Trojan.Unless you want to uncomfortably conceive a baby during a one night stand, just go to the pharmacy so you know what you're buying.",1.0
16,B0083HLPLA,"Everyone knows Trojan is the brand that you can trust. Reliable, no breakage. And, the Magnums are the perfect fit for me. And seriously, what a value, a 36 pack for $13 is unreal – I pay that for a 3 pack at the convenience store. I also use to get Hard 8 male enhancement at the same store, it works, but $13 for one dose is pricey. You can get Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido on Amazon, an entire month supply for $40!",5.0
17,B0083HLPLA,"I have gone through a few boxes of these and I still dont have kids.0 illegitimate children/10, would wear again A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",5.0
18,B0083HLPLA,"These balloons are terrible.The colors are really boring, and they're all greasy.",5.0
19,B0083HLPLA,"Yup, they're condoms.  If you're unsure about whether you like these specifically I'd suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.",5.0
20,B0083HLPLA,"excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.",5.0
21,B0083HLPLA,My boyfriend and I are very happy with these condoms. He doesn't feel choked and I can hardly feel them. No issues at the moment. If your man is larger than most go with these. Best purchase I made in awhile,5.0
22,B0083HLPLA,I only buy these to make people think I have a huge... you know what... when they see these gold wrappers laying around.,5.0
23,B0083HLPLA,I bought magnum condoms in the store a few times and wanted to see if I can find them a lil cheaper and I did on amazon.  So I purchased them. when it got home I used it rite away and love them. It fits perfectly and it's not to tight like other condoms.,5.0
24,B0070YFJGO,"Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!",5.0
25,B0070YFJGO,Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.  Some other reviews have said that the lotion is too effective but I found it to work perfectly for my needs.  I guess the only way to know for each person is to try it out for yourself.,5.0
26,B0070YFJGO,"I was kinda nervous about putting that chemical on my penis but it wasn't that bad like other reviews say. Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.",5.0
27,B0070YFJGO,"This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don't already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn't recommend that you use these.  You might find out the ""hard?"" way that you don't really need any extra help.",3.0
28,B0070YFJGO,"Never had condoms break before I've tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same ""procedure"", ""preparation"", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.",1.0
29,B0070YFJGO,"Good condom brand. I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!",5.0
30,B0070YFJGO,"I picked these ones because of the amazon coupon you can clip but I'm glad I did.The dots and ribs ad lots of pleasure for her and honestly these are the best quality condoms I've ever used, these things stretch like crazy without breaking.Definitely recommend!",5.0
31,B0070YFJGO,Every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it. I have to remove that hard solid stuff to make sure I would not get hurt by this silly condom.,1.0
32,B008UYN4QA,"I have been a big fan of Trojan condoms forever, everyone knows of Trojan’s legendary reliability. Trojan ribbed have been my go-to for some time know. I decided to try Bareskin and they do deliver on feel – it is like you are wearing nothing at all. I have had some issues with tearing/breaking, so definitely be careful as you are getting extra feel but losing some strength with the thinner condom. Overall, a good product. If you are looking for a great libido booster, try Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido let me tell you, you won’t be sorry!",5.0
33,B008UYN4QA,"Yes, they are definitely extremely thin and they do, indeed, feel like bare skin, but I've never had an issue with a condom tearing until I got these. I've used two of them and both have torn at the tip, and I almost didn't notice it in time because it already felt like I wasn't wearing anything. I don't know if there was a quality control issue or what, but I'm not going to be using these ever again, no unwanted babies for this guy! I almost didn't write a review, but I felt like I should warn everyone of the tearing issue.",1.0
34,B008UYN4QA,"after carefully reading all the previous reviews I decided to give this a chance, actually im very happy i did, it really feels like you are wearing nothing and the best part of this is that i did not have any problem, I really recommend it, I first ordered a pack of 10 but I already ordered 3 more :-D",5.0
35,B008UYN4QA,"Yea they're thin for sure and you can feel more while having sex. There is a trade off between thin and strength that people need to be aware of. They do break if you are not careful, and by careful I mean well lubricated. Life pro tip: don't finish inside.",4.0
36,B008UYN4QA,I've used different types of confoms and have never had a problem with one breaking until this type. And it's not just a little split... His penis breaks completely through. So at least we knew. We've tried it 4 different times and they were a brand new box. Would not recommend.,1.0
37,B008UYN4QA,"Excellent in terms of higher degree of feeling, however, be careful, had them break twice.  You can't make them thinner without sacrificing strength, a serious concern if you're trying to avoid STD or pregnancy.",3.0
38,B008UYN4QA,I've been buying trojan condoms for years and have always been satisfied. But this are super bad. I have had only 1 condom tearing in the last 3 years maybe. But this I had 3 tearing in the last month. I still like trojan but this 'model' is super bad dont risk it!,1.0
39,B008UYN4QA,These condoms are basically identical to the Zero Zero Four by Okamoto Okamoto 0.04 Zero Zero Four Condoms 10ea pack . They're both made in Japan and have the same type of font/type face for the expiration date and lot number. I've tried them both and they feel identical to each other. The fit and feel to these condom are exactly the same so if had to make a guess they're both made at the same plant. I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback. I'd suggest any guy or girl that frequents bars or clubs to carry one of these with you when you go out.,5.0
40,B010MR7F6W,"This is a great product, and at this price, it makes no sense to ever have to buy in a store (which I find embarrassing to begin with). In my local stores, you usually will end up spending $10+ to get a 10-12 pack of Trojans. A 40 pack at this price is a no-brainer! Plus the variety is nice, although I am not a big fan of the Double Ecstasy variety. Great product at a great value. If you are looking for a natural Viagra alternative, try Vialus Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido you won’t be disappointed.",5.0
41,B010MR7F6W,11/10 would buy again.  Did not get wife pregnant.  Worked as expected.,5.0
42,B010MR7F6W,"He's not really into condoms, but I'm not really into being pregnant. These work well enough.",5.0
43,B010MR7F6W,came as expected,5.0
44,B010MR7F6W,Best bang for the buck! =),5.0
45,B010MR7F6W,Real good.. better wear a latex.. if you don't want that late text.. that I think I'm late..,5.0
46,B010MR7F6W,Still not a father,5.0
47,B010MR7F6W,These condoms have a good price and the different kinds fit perfectly. The lubrication makes it feel really good on my John. The condoms fit to multiple sizes of little or big Willy's. Great product and they don't leak.,5.0
48,B0073RAL3O,No children yet.,5.0
49,B0073RAL3O,"It may be a bit odd for a woman to rate these, but I have to help encourage men to use them.  I love sex as much as anyone, and keeping safe is VERY key.  These condoms help keep me safe, and feel amazing on my side.  My male partners also really appear to enjoy them a lot too.  No complaints on either end with these great condoms.As an addition, sex is often more enjoyable with some extra lubricant.  I have found that when he is using a condom with ribs, it tends to need some extra lubricant to keep me from getting a bit sore or raw.  I'm just trying to make this a great review and informational for the gents so you keep your lady happy and healthy.  Also keep in mind some ladies have allergies to latex, so never use these with a woman who does.I also want to add that those of you gents who do use lube, that you use water based so as not to cause a condom failure and put everyone at risk.For those of you who explore more non-traditional sex, make sure to take your time, use lots of lube, go slow and lubricate multiple times.  These condoms work well for this too, just take it easy.One last thing, for you gents to remember, these do have an expiration date, so keep them current, keep them handy, and keep some lube with you as well.So gentleman, do the right thing and get some to keep with you, and keep you and your partner safe.  Trust me, your partner will enjoy these greatly!Feel free to ask any questions you may have.Lisa",5.0
50,B0073RAL3O,My wife loves these. Less lubricant than other condoms so there's a bit more friction for her pleasure. Inside it feels like numbing lubricant is present which extends my endurance. I have also been using Testorin - Powerful Testosterone Booster to Supercharge Your Workouts and Sex Drive and Increase Muscle Mass. and it has really helped me in the bedroom! Thanks amazon.,5.0
51,B0073RAL3O,Overall Good condom. They're ribbed but my Girlfriend said she didnt feel a difference. But they work well and havent ripped on me yet. Trojan are the Best!,5.0
52,B0073RAL3O,"For me, the most important thing in a condom is the strength and durability. I dont care about the thickness or other things in a condom so i dont have anything to say but that this condom is unbreakable and I can really trust it.",5.0
53,B0073RAL3O,It won't change your sex life but it should help to make your partner enjoy the process a little more. The ribs seem to work well and the latex is thick enough to feel sturdy.,5.0
54,B0073RAL3O,"Totally fine condom. If your partner likes ribbed condoms, this is one of the more intensely ribbed options. The thicker ribs make the entire condom feel thicker though, and when coupled with the very annoying lubricant (gets everywhere, and tastes absolutely terrible) it results in a condom that is kinda ""meh""But, no breaks or children, so it does its job!",3.0
55,B0073RAL3O,These are mine and my wife's favorite Trojan variety. We're very happy with them and we like that they came in a bigger size box. And at a better price than walmart.,5.0
56,B00JKDH7WM,"My boyfriend and I had to go back to using condoms because the pill wasn't working out for me. We were hesitant about this brand at first because before I went on the pill we tried so many different brands and there was such a loss of feeling to them, a lot of times he couldn't keep an erection while wearing one. But with this brand, it truly is the closest thing to wearing nothing! It's amazing how much better it feels than a regular condom. We only buy these and Trojan ultra thin condoms now. They are the two best brands on the market if your partner has trouble keeping an erection with a normal condom. Also, we have never had one break so they seem to work just as well. Very happy with them. Give them a try!",5.0
57,B00JKDH7WM,For someone with sensitive skin that reacts to just about everything (including latex) I have to say I got no skin reaction from this product. Would recommend to anyone with sensitive/reactive skin.,5.0
58,B00JKDH7WM,"Did a bit of shopping to prepare for the upcoming winter. Got a jacket, scarf and these gloves... Very confused by the packaging. Why are they individually wrapped? I've got two hands! The materials are also rather odd. Very slippery and doesn't seem well insulating. There must of been budget cuts at the factory after dealing with all the individual packaging because there's no finger holes! 0 out of 10 would not recommend. But I'm giving 5 stars just because I admire how unbreakable this weird thin stuff is.",5.0
59,B00JKDH7WM,"This box is ok if you want to try lifestyles variety in non-laytex. I am allergic to laytex so these are great and actually feel better than regular laytext condoms. However, within this variety box me and my bf found that the extra lubricated (inside and outside condom) ones where just a pain in the ass! (no pun intended , heheheh), they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful! we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn't come off and it was more of a mood killer. The other condoms in the box are great and stay put!",3.0
60,B00JKDH7WM,"I absolutely love this brand of condoms and won't be ordering any other brands in the future. They feel very comfortable and thin, and I haven't had one break yet. Unlike normal condoms they don't have that gross rubber smell. They're also perfect for people like me who have a latex allergy, and the ribbed condoms feel amazing! Extra lube is also pretty good. If you're not sure what type to get I'd try their variety pack.",5.0
61,B00JKDH7WM,"Feels like the real thing. Not pregnant, none have broken. Great replacement for hormonal birth control and inexpensive. I will buy again. The weirdly studded ones aren't our favorite but there's something for everyone in this fun pack. I recommend buying it to see which ones in the pack you and your partner enjoy & then buying what you like in bulk. Have safe fun my fellow Amazon shoppers!",5.0
62,B00JKDH7WM,Best condoms on the market by far.I don't think I've ever had one break and the fact they are not made of latex is awesome due to the lack of smell.The assortment is also nice!,5.0
63,B00JKDH7WM,Great product except my vagina is very sensitive to the lubricant on the condoms which caused me to get a yeast infection so I have to use your non-lubricant ones which are great,3.0
64,B00R3UKU64,I used to be a fan of the Thin Magnum but these are now my top choice it really is Thinner than Thin and has a great feel to it.  It says there is less lubricant than normal but if you know what you're doing then that shouldn't be a problem unless your lady has a problem and can't really get wet if so then you probably already have lube handy,5.0
65,B00R3UKU64,"If you've got to wear a condom, this is the one to use.  The BareSkin condoms are utterly amazing.  I've previously only used the Magnum Thin condoms but even they sometimes (maybe even frequently) lead to such a reduction in sensitivity that gladly kills my boner.  Sure, you're always going to know you're wearing a condom but these let me feel everything, seemed to go with the movement, and seemed to be a little looser than other Magnum condoms.  Given how impossibly thin the BareSkin condoms are, the bit of extra wiggle room - whether perceived or actual - probably contributes to its strength.  If a normal sized condom feels snug and you have $8, there's ZERO reason to not try these.  I mean, who says, ""I wish the latex was a little bit thicker.""??",5.0
66,B00R3UKU64,"I wish they had these when I was in college! I've always hated condoms and I must have tried over 30 different brands and types over the years. These ones though I am happy with! (Well, as happy as someone can be when using them that is.) They fit well, you can feel a bit more than with other condoms, and the price is right. Just be sure to use a good lube!",4.0
67,B00R3UKU64,"My girlfriend commented on these during our first use! She asked me if I was using a different condom, and that it felt amazing! I used to use the Trojan Magnum Thin, but these are WAY thinner, and let you feel WAY more. They also have less lubricant (FYI if that's an issue) but on the plus side they don't have the rather unpleasant lubricant smell of the Magnum Thin's and Original's.",5.0
68,B00R3UKU64,"Taking thin to the new level.  you have tried the thins..  well, now it is time to step to the BareSkins.  I gave the thins 10 stars (well, I gave five and my girlfriend gave five).  We give these 15 stars total.  That is right, a 50% increase in mutual satisfaction.  If it can't be skin on skin, go with the BareSkins.  You will not regret it.",5.0
69,B00R3UKU64,Simply the best condom ever. My partner noticed the difference and stated it felt as if i was not wearing a condom at all. I can also feel the extreme difference in comparison to other condoms. This one is very thin and diminish sensitivity very little. Since my first purchase tis is my 3 box with no breakages yet.,5.0
70,B00R3UKU64,"After trying so many condoms I have finally found my go to. Please Trojan, do not stop making these and keep on making more.",5.0
71,B00R3UKU64,"Much thinner then previous Magnums.  It's annoying though that I can't seem to find the Magnum XL anymore. These ones fit very tight and left a deep purple ring on my penis and as in sure most of you reading this are aware, these don't cover the entire length of the penis either.  If they made these a little longer/wider I feel like they would be my go to condom. Hopefully they'll see enough of us complaining and make the Magnum XL in a bare skin style.",3.0
72,B0073RLP3Y,"I hate condoms.  Almost as much as I hate hormonal contraception.  However, with a two-year-old and a two-month-old at home, my husband positively refuses to come anywhere near me without one.  By luck, when I first went shopping for condoms a month ago, I purchased these.  They were AWESOME.  I decided condoms weren't so bad after all.  However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.  (Obviously, I'm new to this, so I wasn't up-to-speed yet on the differences between latex and lambskin condoms.)  There is simply no comparison.  I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.  They're worth every penny.  Just look at it this way:  You could purchase thousands of these, and they'd still be less expensive than a child.  :)",5.0
73,B0073RLP3Y,"After having our first baby, I didn't want to take any form of hormone contraception.  Unfortunately, traditional latex condoms were really uncomfortable for me.  We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.  I'm not aiming to get pregnant with a 6.5-month-old infant at home, and we are happy that these condoms have been the key to allowing my husband and me to keep the love-light burning.  :)Edit:  After nearly four months of use, we've found that the condoms aren't all the same size.  Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.  They're a bit pricy (compared to latex), so that's unfortunate.  Even so, I definitely wouldn't let that stop me from buying another box!  They are definitely the best!",4.0

They transmit all the heat and feeling, and you don't have the problem with friction that you do with latex condoms.My advice: They are a little harder to roll into place, but you can be a little rough with them to tug them down - they've never broken on us.

Husband and I are in our early forties and I have been informed by my physician to consider going off of birth control pills.  I was not open to having my tubes tied (nor the expense), nor did I want an IUD floating around inside me for years.  In addition, my husband was not open to having a vasectomy, as he is a physician and saw one too many men in his office w/difficulties from that procedure.  I ran across this Naturalamb product while shopping at a local pharmacy and took a stab at it.  For the record, my husband and I do not prefer to use condoms, but I took a stab at it and purchased a small box anyway.  Well, suffice it to say that neither I nor my husband have a single complaint about this product.  This product feels very, very natural.  I do  highly recommend.",5.0

So after putting it on you are going to have to go to the bathroom or kitchen to wash your hands with soap, or maybe even kerosene :)))  They stretch (like almost all lifestyles condoms)few moves , and the condom is hanging off like dough.

99,B00U2VYOSG,"I've tried my fair share of condoms purchased off Amazon and these weren't bad.I was a little concerned about the reviews stating they had condoms break, but 6-7 into a 16-pack and so far so good.  And I haven't been going at a snails pace either.They are very thin.  This makes it somewhat difficult to put on.  As I am trying to unroll it (roll it down?), it frequently gets ""stuck"".  By ""stuck"" i mean that it tries to roll into itself (as if it were rolling back up).  So, in the dark, it can be a tedious process.They are a bit tight.  The extra material at the base is a little uncomfortable, but not unbearable unless maybe you keep it on for an extended period of time. A little difficult to get the condom off afterwards compared to other brands/styles.They actually smell pleasant.  A few of the major brands have some smelly condoms, which is slightly off-putting.  But these aren't noticeable, though if you happen to be up-close to it, it is pleasant.All in all, I probably won't buy again.  Might be better for a less girthy member.  I'll probably just purchase Lifestyles Skyn in the future.  Equal amount of pleasure, but easier to put on and take off, as they are a little larger.",4.0

They are super thin and they are the closest thing to feeling like you are dipping your candle without one.  Knock on wood... I have never had not one rip or tear on me even with rough use.

104,B0064FHD5A,"I've used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don't roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a ""choking"" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren't so damn tight. For reference I'm about 8.5"" long and 2"" wide (6.25"" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can't believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don't dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don't feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I'm guessing that's because they are the ""thin"" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you're not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I'd say if you're over about 7"" long or 6"" around (1.75"" wide) you should definitely give these a try.FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn't have a single one rip, so I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I'm guessing since they're the ""thin"" version maybe if you don't have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.",5.0
105,B0064FHD5A,"You're probably going to try several different brands and types before finding the condom that's best for your situation.  While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried.Trojan has another version in this line called the Trojan Magnum Ecstasy 3 Pack that has the larger Magnum head for more ""wiggle"" room but with a base diameter that's between that of this Magnum Thin and that of Trojan ENZ.  This may be a good alternative if worried about the condom staying securely in place and depending on your situation that might be a good thing.  However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4"" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.  Also, the Magnum Ecstasy version I tried had ""Warming and Tingling, Nonoxynol-9"" that left me feeling disconnected from the experience.This Magnum has a water-based lubricant, protects against both STD's and unwanted pregnancy, and for me, this thin version provides the greatest comfort and intimacy of all the versions I've tried in the Magnum line.  I've never encountered bunching or breaking as reported in a few of the other reviews.  These have never let me down (no pun intended) and work well for my situation.Read more ›",5.0
106,B0064FHD5A,"Okay, I'd like to be as brief and as helpful as possible. Men who want to know about this product want to know about two things:1.  Can a man with an above average or large penis wear this condom comfortably (aka, without being squeezed to death)? Yes...mostly2.  Is this condom actually thinner?  In other words, can I have pleasurable sex with this thing? Absolutely YESI'm a larger guy who needs a bigger condom.  I've been married for years.  I don't always wear a condom, but when I do, I wear Magnum.  Always.  Magnum is my brand because they don't strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should've been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn't enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it's a little snug at the base....It doesn't seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I'm not going to be the guy who says it feels like there's nothing on.  I mean, let's be honest:  If you're wearing a condom, sex isn't as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: ""Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.""  I thought so as well.  It is definitely thinner, and to put it courteously, fun was had by all.  If you need to wear a larger condom and you actually want to feel like you're having sex with a woman, then this is your condom.",5.0

A 26 pack at this price is a no-brainer.I have found these ""ecstacy"" types to occasionally have a ""weird"" smell.  My girlfriend doesn't seem to notice/mind, so I could be alone in this thinking, but I could definitely do without the smell.  Also, she has mentioned that this type causes a very different sensation than any other condoms for her.  She says it is not bad, per say, but not something she wants to use every single time.

I've used cooling/menthol lube in the past and it just felt like a cold burn. This was nice and tingly.

I've tried 7 brands to date, and nothing quite matches up to this one. I will add that I have not tried lambskin as the price points for the better ones don't quite match up with how often my partner and I enjoy having sex.The ONLY reason I can't give it 5 stars is the packaging.  Holy hell ... you're all fired up and try to open up a new box - next thing you know you've got a half-chub and you're still fumbling with the ridiculous plastic wrap that seems to be impossible to open unless you're not in the throes of love making.I could open the box before-hand - which I do - but sometimes you just don't realize you're out.Anyway, love this condom and recommend it to others strongly.",4.0

131,B01J939GVC,"This is a good innovation.  There are only three condoms that even come close to this one and I will rank them all in this review: the Trojan Naturalamb Lubricated Condoms, 10ct (packaging may vary), the Lifestyles Skyn Selection Condoms, 24 Count, and the Okamoto Condom 0.03 Platinum Condoms 10p.  The closest comparison is the Okamoto, which supposedly holds the Guinness World Record for being the thinnest.I would rate them as follows:1. LELO Hex2. Okamoto 0.033. Lifestyles SKYN4. NaturalLambThe LELO fits well and does not slip. It seems slightly longer than average, but with an average width.  The sensation is very good.  The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.Both the LELO and the Okamoto are better than the SKYN.  The NaturaLamb probably has the best sensation of any of these, but it is very expensive, fits like a baggie, and does not protect against STIs.I highly recommend the LELO Hex. It is a long-overdue innovation.",5.0

I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick. One partner reached multiple Oh's and described a very pleasurable experience with Lelo Hex. The sensations I felt allowed me to get where I wanted to go, too!You wont be dissappointed!",5.0

The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.",5.0

But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).",4.0
142,B00IJ68C5C,"I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.",2.0
143,B00IJ68C5C,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.",5.0

It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
146,B00IJ68C5C,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0

163,B00GFYU9EC,"As someone in a long-term monogamous relationship, I recently needed to start using condoms. My criteria were pretty simple: as thin as possible while maintaining protection against unwanted pregnancy.The search began and in the year since, these have proven to be the best for meeting my criteria.  I've tried 7 brands to date, and nothing quite matches up to this one. I will add that I have not tried lambskin as the price points for the better ones don't quite match up with how often my partner and I enjoy having sex.The ONLY reason I can't give it 5 stars is the packaging.

I'm not sure what women they surveyed to design this, but I sure as hell wasn't one of them. It really is rather boring and actually the design that is supposed to make it better, makes it worse.Average condoms have a thickness of 0.0027"". This condom has the same thickness. This makes no sense. They should have made it thinner to enhance feeling. I love my guys natural texture and with a thick condom, I can't feel that raw man design.The average condom is 7.5"" long. This condom is the same. The reservoir tip is much larger than average condoms. This is the only positive part of the different design. This allows for more ejaculation room and allows it to be possible for you to feel this also. I would not recommend using this condom if you are longer than 7 inches.Average shaft and base width for condoms is 2"". The Her Pleasure condom is the same. This does not accommodate for guys on the thicker side.Average condom head width is 2.125"". This condom has a head width of 2.5"". This provides extra head room, too much actually. The idea behind this was that the extra room would cause heat through friction. This idea may sound cool but it doesn't work. It just bunches and doesn't fell good at all. The only good thing about this is that it provides even MORE room for ejaculate if it is needed.The water based lubrication is average. The latex smell is non existent which is great!

You just snap it on, flip it over and BAM, done.  But no, it's filled with actual Durex condoms.  Not being the wasteful type, I feng shuied them around in there, added some water and now Carlos has a styling new bachelor pad.  No more awkward search of the nightstand when he has over a lady-Beta.  He is literally, and I mean literally, swimming in condoms.  All in all, not what I expected but a high quality product.",5.0

217,B002T5L454,"Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .  I personally wish they weren't colored but I know that most flavored condoms are. All of them expire at leat three years out from the date I ordered them.  Some don't expire for 4. We are very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying them again.  Though it will probably be a while before we need to!",5.0
218,B002T5L454,Whats going on Durex? I got my first bowl that didn't have a cover. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover. Despite there being a cover on all the pictures on Amazon. So lets call it what it really is a GAME OF 144 PICKUP. You even put it in one of the tipsiest shapes known to man the fishbowl. Maybe you figure many will be lost and you will have quicker reorders. Would the 2 cents for a cover break the bank at Durex?,1.0
219,B004F0IGES,"The Okamoto 004 is the best overall Latex condom I have come across so far. It basically fits like a regular US condom while being thinner at 0.04. The few condoms in this range in the US such as the Trojan Bareskin and Durex Avanti Bare Latex at about 52mm were way too tight at the base ring. The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower. As of now in 2014 the main Latex condom I personally buy is the Okamoto 004.",5.0

Every time I use them I feel very uncomfortable, like they never seem to fit right, or the specified ""effect"" or ""special lubricant"" or whatever never seems to stack up to their claims. To my knowledge i'm not allergic to latex but with trojan condoms I seem to display qualities of a latex allergy without any of the more unpleasant side effects (swelling, inflamation, ect).Being that I didn't know if latex was the problem I decided for the hell of it to try something else and since lamb skin are less effective percentage wise, my friend recommended these to me about 5 years ago. After seeing a commercial I finally gave in and bought a bulk pack of like 12 or whatever, and I haven't bought another brand since.Not only are they extremely comfortable (as far as these type of products go) but they really do simulate the sensation of ""wearing nothing"" better than any other product on the market. Application and removal is a breeze. no bunching, snagging, pinching or any of those unpleasant problems posed by thick latex style products. And best of all they stretch and conform without ever losing their seal. Fantastic product.",5.0
228,B004N731ZM,"I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction. As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you're ... y'know ... ""oversized,"" you might find these too tight. My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.",5.0
229,B004N731ZM,"Polyisoprene is extremely superior to latex in sensation and comfort, particularly in temperature transfer. Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice.

Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.",5.0
230,B004N731ZM,"Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort.- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation.- They have no particular smell or flavour.- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too.I've also tried recently the Durex polyisoprene condoms (“Avanti Bare” or ”Real Feel”, they can't seem to be able to decide on their marketing), but they were more expensive without offering any obvious benefit, so Skyn are the way to go.",5.0

The fit and feel to these condom are exactly the same so if had to make a guess they're both made at the same plant. I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback. I'd suggest any guy or girl that frequents bars or clubs to carry one of these with you when you go out.,5.0
243,B010NB016S,"The female condom is amazing. It is more pleasurable for both the male & female than traditional condoms; and offers more protection against STDS that can be spread by skin to skin contact by covering the outer area of the vagina. The ring that remains out of the vagina adds extra clitoral stimulation and friction during inner course. My boyfriend question if I was really wearing it the first time we used one, because it felt sooo good he couldn't tell. I love that I can put it in before we even begin to mess around - so there is no momentum lost fumbling around for a condom. Plus since they are non latex you can use any lube you want. They are big, which seemed weird at first glance- but once I tried them I was hooked.  I just wish local stores carried them.I have literally given them to all my friends to try.

I find that missionary position works best so you can hold on to the condom. Switching positions didn't work out too well. So for me, once you put it in and start a position, stay in that position if you can. The spermicidal lube really helped the feeling for my spouse. Good luck!",3.0

Sure, for someone wanting an inexpensive yet reliable latex condom they're pretty good. As far as size goes; I'm average in width (55mm) and length; I guess I'm used to using polyurethane condoms that don't stretch and fit snug; something I was hoping would also be the case with these. The base of these holds pretty tight and the shaft is pretty close, but they stretch ALOT and don't hold tight quite like the poly condoms do that dont stretch. These came packaged lose inside a plastic mailing bag; they were doubled (two condoms) per piece; labeled not for retail sale. I was actually surprised to see these as in my mailbox because I had canceled my order; yet someone at CS must have made a mistake and sent them anyway. I'm not complaining, getting a bag chocked full of condoms for free isn't a bad deal.

We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price.

No complaints on either end with these great condoms.As an addition, sex is often more enjoyable with some extra lubricant.

These condoms work well for this too, just take it easy.One last thing, for you gents to remember, these do have an expiration date, so keep them current, keep them handy, and keep some lube with you as well.So gentleman, do the right thing and get some to keep with you, and keep you and your partner safe.

290,B000BK5TVY,"Here's my review, first off, I didn't purchase from Amazon. I got it from condomdepot .com. I purchased a 24 pack ($9.99), googled for a discount, found one at 12% off, and used the free priority shipping.  It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk. I searched for the best price before I purchased, even looked here, and I felt the price there was already pretty good, add the free shipping and the discount and my mine was made.Now as far as use goes, I thought the condom looked smaller than other condoms, but it slipped right on my sweetie with no problems. I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything. I got these condoms for HIM, because I wanted us to be protected but I wanted him to be able to feel as much as possible. I also noticed that there was no latex and sex smell after we were done.Read more ›",5.0

300,B0047526G0,"Most people will see the thickness and be turned off but there is a trick to getting the most out of this condom. Try unrolling it a bit before putting it on. Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you. This will create friction inside and friction is feeling. With a normal condom you have to rely on stretching to create this friction. The tapered end should hold securely onto the base (if your sized right), but I would test things out solo to make sure there are no surprises.",5.0

I generally need a larger condom and the comfort tip on these accommodate that nicely. They're thin enough that they're not restrictive and though they fit me a little more on the snug side I've been loyal to this brand/style for over ten years and I've yet to break one which is more than I can say for many of the others I've tried. They're offered here at a great value and if you're an average or larger man I'd recommend these!If you're on the smaller side, I'd recommend you try something different as I imagine these might be a struggle to keep on for smaller guys because of the combination of them being on the thinner side and the comfort tip.",5.0

329,B0070YFJKK,"Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!",5.0

332,B0070YFJKK,"This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.

Hormonal birth control works in that it kills my normally healthy sex drive so we often use condoms.My husband can't use regular condoms.  Period.  They are too tight and end up effecting his ability to stay ... well ... effective.  Girth is the issue here rather than the length.  The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9"".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don't seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don't have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you're rolling in the dough.I never had problem like that with past partners and was barely aware of the size of XL.  I finally broke down and researched enough to see if my husband was extra sensitive or extra large as the size indicates.  I learned that the girth size suggested for condoms according to www.condom-sizes.org are as follows:  (measure the girth at the midpoint of the erection):Regular:  girth < 5.3""Magnum:  5.3"" < girth < 5.5""XL:  5.5"" < girth < 5.8""out of luck: 5.8"" < girthMuch to my husband's annoyance, I forced a measurement and found him to have a 6.0"" circumference, average is somewhere around 4.8"".

Shame on them. European brands like ""MySize"", ""TheyFit"" and ""Pasante"" are built with similar quality standards as Trojan and they have much real larger sizes. The problem is that it is very difficult to get them.By the way, compare the Magnum Trojan XL packaging size with another brand.

I'll tell you my size to put it in perspective: I'm almost 7"" with above-average girth.  I'm kind of big.  The large condoms fit me fine.

For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers.

Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2"" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir. I've read that these condoms are ~1.4"" girth, but up to 2"", you'll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don't work out for you.",5.0

353,B00C33CVSQ,I really like these. I am a smaller girth so these work well. They are thin so there is more feel. They have never slipped of during intercourse however when you pull out after an unload make sure to hold it from the base to avoid if from slipping off.,5.0
354,B00C33CVSQ,"These are absolutely fantastic condoms.  It isn't the size that matters, it's how you use it - but you can't use it if you don't get a good fit with protection!  That's where LifeStyles ""Snugger fit"" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up ""averages"" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?  It infuriates me that they don't carry these in stores.  Not everybody has a porn star penis.  Get real.CON:  I didn't like that they arrived in a Ziploc bag.  That was weird.

As you can see from my profile, I'm just a typical consumer.*5 stars*: This rating means the item matches the item description and is a good value for the price listed at the time I reviewed it. I recommend it feeling confident that most people who read the description and take price into consideration will be pleased with it. If it exceeds my expectations and is an exceptional value, I put that in the heading.

361,B009729698,"The only reason I ever ordered these condoms was because my girlfriend has a latex allergy. I figured they'd be lame because A) condoms are annoying to begin with, and B) if good condoms could be made from something other than latex, than why is latex the de facto standard for like every condom in the universe?Well, I still don't know the answer to B), but after going through a box of Skyn condoms, I can honestly say that I would use them even if my partner weren't allergic to latex. They feel significantly better than the condoms I've used in the past (Trojans), and they're reliable. As a bonus, buying them here is vastly cheaper, more convenient, and less embarrassing than buying them at Walgreen's. I'd recommend this product to anyone who relies on condoms for birth control with a significant other, latex allergy or not.When I ordered a second box, the seller accidentally put the wrong item in the package. The packing slip showed the correct order, but instead of 50 Skyn condoms there were 50 Snugger Fit condoms, which are made from latex. I contacted the seller through Amazon, explained that the latex condoms were useless to me because of my girlfriend's latex allergy, and requested that the correct item be sent to me as soon as possible.My complaint was filed on Monday night. On Tuesday morning I had a response from the seller, who apologized for the error and said that the correct item was on its way. On Wednesday morning the correct condoms were on my doorstep via Fed Ex. Although I was pretty annoyed when I got the wrong item in the package, the seller's blistering fast customer service and immediate correction have left me with an even higher esteem for the folks who make these condoms.",5.0

Don't listen, Im 7 1/2 and close to two inches in diameter and these roll almost all the way down to the base and don't feel too tight. I don't get the ""plastic bag"" sensation with these.

Nonetheless, I hate condoms to the extent where just opening the wrapper made Senor Johnson go back to sleep almost instantaneously.But Senor Johnson approves of these.  They're so thin that you'd think they'd tear easily, but I've never had one of these fail in my life.  They're well lubed without leaving you sliding all over the place, and they don't have that noxious smell that gets progressively worse as bodily fluids get involved.  These are as inoffensive as condoms get.The only problem with them is that they're a bit tight, even by average standards.  For average Joes, that might be a good thing since it's absolutely impossible to slip out of these unless Senor Johnson passes out.  But if your Senor Johnson is pornstar tier, these might feel more like a mechanical vice than a condom.

Condoms are condoms anyway so as long as they do the job, I am ok with any brand -- except small ones, of course. I was hoping to get regular sized condoms and I think that's what I got. I said ""I think"" because I am familiar with all the brands that arrived but not the specific model/variety. I'll be talking more about the brands, too.First off, the condoms came in an (see photo) envelope-sized packaging with bubble wraps inside. So you do not have to worry about receiving a damaged item that may happen during shipping. I like that the package is discreet.Inside, the condoms were packed in another plastic bag that said 'Sold as set, do not separate.' And when opened comes the revelation of which brands were in my package. It felt fun, too. I felt like a kid opening a gift, eager to find out what's inside. I actually just got four varieties of condoms, but just two brands. The condom brands/names were: CautionWear Black Ice, CautionWear PPE, Beyond Seven (orange), Beyond Seven (green). I got six of each, which makes 24. Photos attached (unopened, of course). All styles are lubricated. I was quite pleased to see brands that I recognize and honestly like using and frequently buy: Beyond Seven is a good condom brand in my opinion so I am happy that I got them. Cautionwear is good, too, but I only know of IronGrip variety. I know these brands are unfamiliar to some, but I know my condoms and these brands are good. LOL.

These work well, I honestly don't feel much difference between types, my husband says the thinner the better. He has always liked the durex brand best so we stick with it. None have broken and overall, these are more affordable. Here's hoping they do their job and we don't have any surprises too soonWill reorder when we need more.Update: we have been really disappointed with the orange condoms. They are weird and uncomfortable. They made up half our box too.After using these for a while, I have really come to dislike the smell and consider the various chemicals used on them as a problem for me. I mean, I try to be chemical free in everything else, so after a little thought, I decided to opt for a latex condom without chemical lubricants and dyes and fragrance. You can buy these on Amazon too, they are called sustain condoms.

The Trojan ones were really too small and very tight and I don't think very well lubricated. I would absolutely recommend this product if you are trying out condoms, it's a lot cheaper than buying an entire box of something you may not like or doesn't fit well.

421,B00HRU9YDU,"Wow, these are some of the first condoms I've ever enjoyed and I've tried nearly all the alternative styles.  Perhaps because I'm also a little larger, so the comment that said it's a ""trash bag"" is more about sizing than anything else.  Great for bigger guys, there's room and it is tapered at the bottom so it stayed on great.",5.0
422,B00HRU9YDU,"My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.",5.0
423,B00HRU9YDU,"I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.Size:I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.Shape:They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.Lube:The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.",5.0
424,B00HRU9YDU,"If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the ""ribbing"" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I've ever encountered.  Frigging' Yuck.",1.0
425,B00HRU9YDU,"These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.",2.0
426,B00HRU9YDU,"Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.",5.0

428,B00328R398,"I really like these Crown condoms because of their thinness (.04mm) and how well they fit. I would put these slightly above the Durex Extra Sensitive ultra thin condoms 24 pack (Pack of 2). These two condoms are my favorite but these Crown condoms are my #1 choice. And there must be a reason these Crown condoms are the #1 choice of pornstars when they have to use condoms.As for these Crown condoms I was a little cautious about using them at first since they are pretty thin and was worried about them breaking but I've had some pretty intense and rough sex with different women and these have yet to break on me. Also I'm not sure how hung some of the reviewers are complaining about these condoms not fitting but I'm bigger than average with good girth and they fit me really well. So unless you're Lex Steele these condoms are gonna be just fine for 99.9% of users. And for the lucky .1%, there are Magnums and other condoms of that ilk.My only gripe with these condoms is the way they arrive. All 50 condoms are loose and not packaged in a nice little box.P.S. I was lucky enough to win a gag gift basket at a friends bachelor party which included OKAMOTO CONDOMS ZERO ONE 0.01mm 3pcs MADE IN JAPAN - 3Boxes and MY GOD those condoms were AWESOME. It totally feels like you got nothing on. But these .01mm condoms are expensive. I'm sure Amazon has better deals than what these cost.",5.0
429,B00328R398,"Just to preface, I wasn't super thorough about all of this.I just so happen to have a batch of Crown condoms from years ago. I ordered them from Condom Depot on October 5, 2010. They expired June 2015, and are from batch number T170. December 14, 2015, I ordered the same condom from Amazon. They expire October 2019, and are from batch number T4Y4. I have no guarantee that the old batch was produced in Japan, but there is a slight chance. Condom Depot wrote an article (""Crown Condoms Thailand & Japan What’s The Deal?"") regarding the differences between manufacturing locations, dated March 11, 2009. In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row. So do you think they sold 400,000 condoms in more than 19 months? The odds probably fall in that direction. Anyway, let's see if this unnecessarily thorough review helps anyone!Sensation: The older batch seems to have a slight better sensation to it, but they're both so similar that it is extremely difficult to tell.Thickness: Placing the two, still rolled, side by side, the older batch seems to be ever so slightly thinner. This goes against the article from Condom Depot, as they state those manufactured in Japan are 0.005mm thicker than those made in Thailand. Curious about this, I tried measuring two others that were still in their packaging. Keep in mind that I have a crappy $15 digital caliper, but the old batch came to 3.31mm, and the new batch 3.46mm. I tried not to squish them, so I based my measurements off of how much drag I felt when removing the caliper after measuring.Read more ›",5.0
430,B00328R398,"Arrival was timely and fit is snug but not painful. Not planning a bedroom marathon with these so they're fine for now. They do feel more like bare skin than anything else tried, but the light lubrication didn't seem like it was there at all. In fact, it seemed like there wasn't any and with BC pills natural lube isn't always there. So, without the help of a lube bottle these can actually end up hurting both of us because of the dry rub. Still, they're liked and not a bad purchase for a small tester pack.",4.0
431,B00328R398,From a female perspective these are by far the greatest condoms out there. It feels almost like there's nothing at all between us. These are way better than the ultra thins on the market. We will never buy another brand.,5.0
432,B00328R398,"Well, in terms of protection, Crown skinless has always been my go-to brand and style. Next to that, Beyond Sevens, however most people vouch for Crown over Beyond Seven (both produced by the same company, however Crown is featured in many ahem, feature films...)The crown is comfortable, if a little snug for most men. It's also relatively thin, along the lines of .0042 thickness, if I recall correctly. You can get .002 and .002 thickness with other Japanese brands, however the price increases exponentially and the availability decreases as well. Crown is a wonderful go-between, but do be careful regarding the manufacturing locations.Many years ago I purchased them when they were the original silver and blue packaging. They were thin and barely felt like they were there. These new blue and white packets feel thicker to me for some reason, though it could be because I went for a period without the need for condoms, and now that things have changed, it's hard adapting back to the ole latex.I've used MANY of these condoms and have not had one failure. They are only lightly lubricated so make sure things are good to go before going at it or you'll create some heavy friction that's unpleasant for your partner (and bad for the latex). Very little smell on these, which is great, and the pink color almost makes it look invisible, which is another bonus.I am getting used to these, and have almost finished my current 50 pack. If you're a Durex or generic store-brand user, you owe it to yourself to give the Crowns a shot. They will literally blow your mind.",4.0

436,B0040VPJVK,"I refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised.  The packaging looks different even though they say its the same product (ultra thin line of trapan's).  also, even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom I got in a 3 pack from walmart a few weeks ago.  These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....",1.0
437,B0040VPJVK,"First of all, these are not real US Trojan condoms. They are a knockoff, made in Thailand. When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.",1.0

They're safer than the regular sizes (won't slip off) and super nice on the wearer's ego (""snug fit"" sounds better than small).  It also makes a really thoughtful gift for the guy who has trouble finding his size or didn't even realize condoms came in a range of sizes - who doesn't appreciate a personalized gift?",5.0

449,B00C350E2Y,"This is just gonna be a short review, with photos attached.These are hands down my favorite condom.They are great in size (if you are above average.) They don't have any bad latex condom smell,  because of the material. They sometimes make me forget I'm even wearing one, because of how the fit.So I just ordered these and got them the other day.At first I wasn't sure whether to get them or not, because people say that they arrived in a plastic bag, and that they were not in the original box.After asking some people, I came to the conclusion, that I was gonna get them.I ordered them the 14th, and the estimated delivery time was between the 20th-25th.They were already shipped the 15th, and delivered to my place the 19th!!!First picture is what the envelope looked like, all the blurred boxes are just my personal info. It didn't say anything about condoms or whatever, for the people who prefer the discrete way.Second one you see the condoms, between 2 pieces of cardboard with a pretty decent thickness. To prevent any damages on shipping. Which I thought was brilliant.And let me not forget to say, that the envelope of course had bubble wrap too.Last one you see all the condoms lined up, they all come in pairs of 2, like they do when you buy them in their original box in a store.And then there was 1 extra one, that was just on its own, which I thought was a little weird? Why not just 24? Why not just 26?. But maybe they had some sort of idea with that, or just adding a little bonus..Ordering condoms online, I was definitely a bit naive. So I went ahead and checked each and every condoms for holes. And of course I didn't find any holes lol.I will definitely reply to any questions you may have, just to be nice to people in doubt, or wondering if these condoms are for them. Because I, was one of those people.",5.0

Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.

I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India.

453,B00C350E2Y,"I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.",4.0

If you're one of us that has been frustrated with slippage, BUY THESE!!! you might even find them too tight so I'd recommend getting the 12 count to make sure these are for you.  A lot of folks consider these the snuggest condoms on the market.  I also find the excess length of these on me acts as c-ring, which adds to my pleasure by prolonging climax.  For those of us on the short end of things, these are an awesome choice; good tight fit, lower price and peace of mind when used.

After taking the recommended dosage for the first 5 days I noticed that I not only had more energy, but I also noticed an increase of my sex drive. This has definitely shown me that it has the potential to change my life in a very positive way. I will continue to use it as long it gives me the results that it has so far. I would recommend this to anyone that has any issues with there sex drive or energy level.Update...It's been a few weeks now and I just purchased another bottle of this Tongkat Ali. I have found that shortly after running out of the first bottle I ordered, the extra energy and increased sex drive had began to wain. I don't know if my case is different then most people, but I dealt with a severe illness for the last 18 years of my life (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). For anyone not familiar with that illness...you basically feel like you have a severe case of the flu every day, which includes full body muscle aches and pain along with brain fog, poor sleep, non existent sex drive, no energy...and just an overall feeling of frustration.When I had first heard on the internet about Tongkat Ali being a natural way to improve not only my energy level, but also my sex drive and I just had to give it a try. It was recommended that you should only get the Indonesian form...and you should get at least 1:100 strength. After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it. I'm so glad that I made the choice that I did. I was so surprised by the results I just have to get another bottle to keep that feeling going.

But i have to say that i feel this company cares for their customers, they have emailed me like 3 times already to find out how i feel about using this product. I haven't reply to any mail until now. I will definetely update any comment about this product in the future to let you know if it worked for me or not. I like to read reviews before buying any product.",5.0
469,B0088FLLK2,"I have been using for about a month.  I researched several key libido/ed herbs and supplements before purchasing.  I have taken normal and double dosages a week at a time - 5 days on 2 days offWhen I doubled up on this product, I noticed an aggressiveness from it.  So it does increase testosterone.  I went back to standard dosage and the aggressiveness went away.  Double dose too much for me.  I am 61, so a little help is good for the libido!Yes, after extensive reading and being a guinea pig, this product does work. I have ordered multiple times while the price is right!I am loving the fact that I am starting to wake up during the night with ""wood"" in my shorts!  Feels good, and it was missing. I am also noticing the women (in a sexual way) around me more in my daily activities. I am more alert and sleep better, so it has to have increased my testosterone levels.It may not work for everyone, but it works for me.  All I can say is try it for at least a month.  I noticed results in two weeks and a slow gradual increase in my feeling of well-being.",4.0

These have ribs that are just right and make it a million times more pleasurable. I don't like a smooth in and out, I like ribs that make it so there's just enough texture to make it more pleasurable but not painful. These are my favorite and I use them all the time except for when my boyfriend is close before we even start. When that happens the Trojan Extended work really, really well. If you want more pleasure and alittle more texture, these are definitely for you.",5.0

488,B0040W5URC,"After years of not using condoms because my wife was on birth control. I thought that the thinner the condom was, the better it would make me feel. I'm a little above average in size. About 6.5-7in. So we tried a whole lot of them. And I found out that I needed ones like these, with lubricant on the inside and outside. And the extra space around the shaft creates the closest feeling to not using one at all. And my wife feels the same way about them. This became our favorite condom line from the very first use!",5.0
489,B0040W5URC,I see some comments saying that the condom is too baggy but it fits me just fine. Just like shoes you have to find the ones that fit you best. The new style Trojan is doing does feel more comfortable than the traditional condom.,5.0
490,B0040W5URC,"A somewhat larger condom that feels good (for a condom), and the lady finds it comfortable.The silicone (?) lubricant seems to work well.  There's a noticeable latex-y smell. It allows for some movement inside the latex (a feature, according to the product description), which might feel a little strange if you're coming from the more tightly fitted Trojan ""Ultra Thin"" series.  Both this ""Her Pleasure"" and the ""Ultra Thin"" are better quality and more comfortable for the lady than the cheaper Durex brand we've also tried.For when you need to cover up, these are a good choice.",5.0

502,B00DZNLAI0,My husband and I love using this. The product is amazing. I must say personally I couldn't have asked for better. I don't have any allergies and there is no junk stuffed in these condoms. I have tried so many and wasted so much money. The great thing is I bought from a seller on here and they were selling it less than the official website and shipping was more affordable too! It worked out quite nicely buying from Amazon! The pleasure dots are just for me and my man doesn't mind one bit. The dots are a nice extra special treat for me. I love them!,5.0
503,B00DZNLAI0,"This is an excellent product with an excellent commitment to giving back. Women love feeling high-class using an extravagant, yet elegant new condom. I absolutely love the feel of Sir Richards pleasure dots. Thin enough to maximize pleasure, while not being thin to the point of worrying about them breaking. 10/10 will buy again.",5.0
504,B00BI0BGL8,LOVE these. Normally we buy them in Durex's Pleasure Pack because we can't find them separately in stores. The flavored condoms in that pack particularly suck because they run extra small and tight. So it was a waste of money basically. But super glad that we found these on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product is perfect quality. Box came a little dented but everything was fine. AND THAT PRICE. What a deal. We will definitely be buying these again. Thank you!,5.0

However, he said that these felt much tighter than the previous ones we had used from the same brand. In fact, there was a visible constriction of his penis around the base of the condom. I was surprised given the excellent track record we have with Durex, but at least none of them broke.",3.0

515,B007O3CPVS,"When Durex first came out with these condoms they were manufactured under the name Colors & Scents. They first appeared in the Pleasure Pack and were such a hit, they were then manufactured by themselves as Durex Tropical. These condoms are great for their purpose. The smell and taste of latex is horrible,If you love oral and like to switch things up a lot or perhaps sometimes are not able to finish with intercourse and then like to follow up with oral...this is perfect for you. There is no lingering taste or smell of latex to turn you off. This goes for guys or gals. It will make your penis or vagina smell and taste like whichever flavor you used during intercourse.These condoms come in three different flavors and sometimes four if you can find the rare fourth flavor of mint. The most common are strawberry, orange, and banana. These are also colored accordingly as red, orange, and yellow. My favorite is the strawberry. I think this has the best taste and flavor. Orange is next and then banana. This is a personal preference though. The mint green ones are great also.In terms of fit, this is how Durex Tropical compared to other condoms: Average condoms have a thickness of 0.0027"". This condom has a thickness of 0.00247"" which makes it a little thinner than most condoms. This will enhance sensitivity a bit.The average condom is 7.5"" long. This condom is also 7.5"". Because of the reservoir tip being small, this is why I recommend not using it on a penis longer than 7"". There needs to be wiggle and ejaculation room.Average shaft width and base width for condoms is 2"". This condom is smaller at 1.75"". This doesn't accommodate the guys on the thicker side. Keep size in mind. It works better for those with less girth.Read more ›",4.0

520,B00HI35HLY,Yes I do have mixed pleasures about these.  Overall they do what they're supposed to.  Which is cover and catch.  Good job team.  They fit a little small which is both good and bad.  The sensitive ones suddenly become super sensitive.  My favorite actually turned out to be the glow in the dark one.  And yes it does work.  open it up first let it collect a little room light while you give your lady a little moonlight. wink wink.  Then strap on.  The small fit does some...lets say extending of time.  And the glow in the dark is actually a little thicker so not quite as sensitive.  All in you will get more bang for your buck...wink wink...nudge nudge...wink wink.,5.0
521,B00HI35HLY,"Unique selection. Fun so far. My wife loves the funny unique wrappers. The pocket tin is definitely nice and convenient. I will update to let you know our favorites and why.Also in regards to the size issues others have had the issue not the length but girth. Length goes to 8 inches but girth is average to small. Which I like it snug it seems to feel better for both of us. And most people don't know this but a lose condom creates friction which in turn will break. And in case you wonder the ""Legend"" one that comes in the pack is slightly bigger than durex or regular Trojan's.",5.0

531,B0183LNHF2,I was excited as soon as I saw the commercial for these condoms and bought them same day. The first one worked fine but neither my partner nor I could tell any difference between these and the classic ribbed.But it went down hill from there the other two times we attempted to use these condoms the friction started to burn so bad we stopped having sex.

554,B00BWMOOD4,"My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.",5.0
555,B00BWMOOD4,"I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.Size:I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.Shape:They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.Lube:The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.",5.0

557,B00BWMOOD4,"These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.",2.0
558,B00BWMOOD4,"Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.",5.0
559,B015RN57VQ,"My wife and I both really enjoyed this condom -- it is SO impossibly thin! And it's magical how little it smells of latex. My wife and I tried this condom while we went on vacation, and we were very pleasantly surprised -- it's very comfortable for me, and when she goes down on me after sex, she likes it because I don't smell like latex. We didn't have a single breakage with over 20 used, and our longest use was about an hour and a half or so.I was seriously doubtful of this brand before (hadn't heard of it, was 'natural'), but I can't sing its praises enough. It does run a little bit smaller than other brands, but just enough that I noticed it and not so much felt uncomfortable. If you go on their website, they also have trial sizes for sale so you can find your size before you buy.",5.0

At first, I was hesitant to buy them since it costs so little for so many(for some reason I felt like a higher price point meant higher protection, feel, etc.)I just gave them a go and was very impressed. Very comfortable, snug fit. Incredibly thin yet very strong and elastic. When paired with a nice lube like Sylk, it's perfect.My girlfriend says they did not hurt like other brands.Thanks Chubby Dick Emporium!(Seriously, try them out.

Thin but strong.  Easy to use.  Fit comfortably.  A lot of people think they provide the best sensation on the market.  In that context, I would rate them way higher than anything made by Trojan, Lifestyles and other better-known manufacturers.

592,B0029XFWPE,"After nearly a decade of using Okamoto Crown condoms exclusively, my husband and I are sad to say that we're going to have to find another brand.  Ordinarily, and regardless of whether or not they were manufactured in Thailand, these condoms had almost no discernible odor and didn't cause any irritation for either one of us.The condoms in the last pack we purchased smelled like a pile of burning tires.  Not only that, but they also caused quite a bit of swelling and irritation.  The lot number and expiration date were E15/T3Z4 and 11/2019, respectively.  The only reason I'm divulging this particular information is because I'd be very curious to know whether or not others have noticed this change or we simply got a bad batch.Either way, we have to begin the search for a new brand of condom, preferably one that doesn't smell like burning rubber or cause the sort of irritation these now cause.",1.0

I'm just warning any of you who have read great reviews on these, because the ones made in Japan are actually really great. These Thailand condoms are cheap and stinky.To be fair, the fit seems to be roughly the same (feels a bit tighter) and my girlfriend and I used one when we ran out of good condoms (durex super thin extra sensitive condoms) and it wasn't awful minus the really disgusting smell (major turn off). The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)Definitely go with the Durex extra sensitive on this one.

It definitely weirded me out at first. When I thought about it I realized of course if you're buying them in bulk they'll arrive that way, it just startled me when I first saw it.

At this rate they'll last forever. Maybe I'll just try them on for fun. Oh - I could learn how to tie balloon animals.",5.0
596,B0029XFWPE,The condom is true to its name. Really feels like nothing is there. Also they are very inexpensive (100pk for 15 dollars) one thing to remember is that as stated on the label it is lightly lubricated. So it's best to apply some extra especially if you plan on going for more then 10 mins. Another thing if you have more girth or length then average you will realize that it can be a snug condom. I personally felt like it didn't roll down close enough to my base a problem I haven't had with any other condom,4.0

626,B0009AHF1S,"Durex extra sensitive condoms are undoubtedly one of the most popular condoms in the World. There is no way one can go wrong with these condoms. They have been credited as being super thin which enhances balminess while at the same time performing their duty of protection.  Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.Sex is a pleasurable moment and when a condom insinuates otherwise then there is a problem. Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.With such an impressive track record and good reputation, Durex extra sensitive condoms are one of the safest condoms out there. Any company that takes Research and Development into account is not only in the business for money. It actually means that they strive for excellence and distinction in providing its customers with the best of the best.Read more ›",5.0

The 001 sagami are the best, but they cost (at the time of writing) literally like, $3-6 each. And I'm not that rich.And for those wondering, Japanese ""large"" is pretty much American regular. I made the mistake of ordering the Japanese regular and they didn't work very well.As they say, you pick two out of three. With condoms it's ""cheap, feels good , durability.""C + F = Typical thin cheap comdoms. These usually are just the same material as regular condoms and will break easier.C + D = Typical condoms. Wont break easily, but also wont feel very good because of how thick they are.F + D = Sagami 001 or 002. They use special processes and materials that raise the price, but what you get is better feel and durability.Cheap + Feel = Thin and will break easily.Quality + Cheap = Thick and feel terrible.FYI If you live near a Japanese supermarket they usually have these on sale.

In fact if these “ large ” condoms were any smaller they would not fit. So if you normally wear large in regular condoms these will not fit you. While these condoms are not the cheapest they are the best we have ever used.One thing you do have to keep in mind is that these are not latex so they do not stretch a lot. Don’t worry I have been using these for years and they have never ripped. On the plus side if you are allergic to latex these condoms are a bonus.Do yourself a favor and pick these condoms up.

These are awesome. They don't look like a normal condom and go on like some sort of hermetic seal. The thin-ness is ASTOUNDING and the feel is perfect. BUT... They're just not as big as a Magnum, which is what fits me best. If these are a ""Sagami Large,"" then PLEASE SAGAMI MAKE AN XL!!!!

May even be daring and try for .01's, but that's pushing it pretty far.Size L is actually just regular size, it's comparable to crown size, but because it's not latex, it's less stretchable. However, it held up quite nicely, had no smell (and very little lube). The packaging it comes in is very chic, and each condom come wrapped in a nice plastic container, similar to daily disposable contacts. These are definitely premium condoms and look the part.

Trojan Supra are made of polyurethane also but they're at 0.04mm thick, rather go latex, fits better.

They don't have any bad latex condom smell,  because of the material. They sometimes make me forget I'm even wearing one, because of how the fit.So I just ordered these and got them the other day.At first I wasn't sure whether to get them or not, because people say that they arrived in a plastic bag, and that they were not in the original box.After asking some people, I came to the conclusion, that I was gonna get them.I ordered them the 14th, and the estimated delivery time was between the 20th-25th.They were already shipped the 15th, and delivered to my place the 19th!!!First picture is what the envelope looked like, all the blurred boxes are just my personal info. It didn't say anything about condoms or whatever, for the people who prefer the discrete way.Second one you see the condoms, between 2 pieces of cardboard with a pretty decent thickness. To prevent any damages on shipping. Which I thought was brilliant.And let me not forget to say, that the envelope of course had bubble wrap too.Last one you see all the condoms lined up, they all come in pairs of 2, like they do when you buy them in their original box in a store.And then there was 1 extra one, that was just on its own, which I thought was a little weird? Why not just 24? Why not just 26?. But maybe they had some sort of idea with that, or just adding a little bonus..Ordering condoms online, I was definitely a bit naive. So I went ahead and checked each and every condoms for holes. And of course I didn't find any holes lol.I will definitely reply to any questions you may have, just to be nice to people in doubt, or wondering if these condoms are for them.

Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.

I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.

I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India.

675,B01FEHW0B0,"I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.",4.0
676,B00IMUGVEY,"These are hands down the holy grail of condoms. I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them.

This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.

680,B00IMUGVEY,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms.

I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
683,B00IMUGVEY,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0

With certain brands I have to use half a gallon of lube just to keep things moist before it goes dry due to the condom, but I haven't had that problem with these.That was one of the biggest differences -- the sensation and the fact that at times it didn't feel like I was wearing anything at all.

Let me tell you why.My girl is sensitive to the latex(esp. trojans) so I have stopped using that brand for a while although the bare skin one was okay.Even though this condom is latex, it was odd that my girlfriend didn't even react to it. She's very sensitive to latex and it irritates her VJ while making it dry but this one didn't even get to that problem.I certainly enjoy using this condom due to many reasons.PRO- It is very thin!!! It is not as thin is Sagami .01mm but thin enough to feel the heat transfer from my girlfriend's VJ- Nicely lubed compared to Skyn and few other brands- It feels like doing raw a bit but ofc, RAW is always the best with the partner you trust.- Fits nicely, little on the tight side but I don't mind it- My girlfriend doesn't react to this latex condom at all!!!- There are thinner condoms out there but this beats their price(vs. Sagami)- Durability is outstandingCON- Can be thinner(sorry for being too greedy) I would like it SUPER THIN if it can be put into production- I seem to be ejaculating a little faster compared to other condoms(also maybe b/c my girl is squeezing more since she feels it more)Nothing really for CON.

693,B0040XYBDK,"Yup, they're condoms.  If you're unsure about whether you like these specifically I'd suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.",5.0

698,B00IMUGVE4,"These are hands down the holy grail of condoms. I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.",5.0
699,B00IMUGVE4,"Perfect. I could even feel the V-temperature inside when I... lol you know.I'm sure if I add a photo, I will lose my amazon account haha :p",5.0
700,B00IMUGVE4,"It's pretty amazing how thin they are, yet can still do the job.  And it's *almost* like you're not wearing anything, but there's no doubt that you are.  But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).",4.0
701,B00IMUGVE4,"I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.",2.0
702,B00IMUGVE4,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.",5.0
703,B00IMUGVE4,Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.,5.0
704,B00IMUGVE4,"I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
705,B00IMUGVE4,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0
706,B00IAT4LNA,"No joke, great condoms.  I have tried the Durex, Lifestyles and many many other brands of rubbers over the last 16 yrs or so.  These are very good, and will feel like your condom broke, but they never do.... super strong.ProGreat feeling,Super tight fit, so no accidental pull offFits all sizes, I am on the very large girth size and use large condoms because of this, but these even in regular are super tight, and add to the don't feel like I'm using them feeling,No smellHeat transfer.... you will feel all the heat and sensation you lose with latex.Cons:Need lube for these, seem to be without lube, even though they are lubed, if issue get lube or use the extra lube ones.Can be tough to put on, take your time and because they are rolled so tight, make sure you check to see if its rolled under its self this will cause it to stop rolling down, just roll up a little and back down, or use lube before you start rolling.Super tight can because of this can cause 1. super sensitivity and will make you finish faster, 2. must pinch tip, because condom will not move during sex, and this can cause issues when finishing up.Over all one of my favorites in condoms.  Love how they feel, love the fact that they don't move during sex, and use these over latex anytime.  This and the fact that they are SUPER strong,and if you have allergies these are a MUST in any brand.",4.0
707,B00IAT4LNA,"If they fit for you, they're the best non-latex condom you can get.  Polyurethane doesn't have much stretch so they're going to feel a bit tighter; that said, the feeling is a lot better.  I'd say if your member is on the low range of the suggested size for a Trojan magnum, then that's the maximum size then these will fit for you comfortably.The good: It's probably the closest to not wearing a condom feel you can get.  This was an issue the first few times I used them because I thought it slipped off.  I've never had an issue with slippage though.  Heat transfer is great.  It's thin so you'll feel a lot more.The bad: They don't roll incredibly easy compared to other condoms.  Practice with one before the first time you're with your partner to save some embarrassment.  I also wish there was a better reservoir tip; breakage hasn't been an issue but a better tip would be nice.  They are tight due to being polyurethane; it's really a personal preference if they're too tight for you.If you're in the market for a non-latex condom your two best options are these and Lifestyles Skyn.  I recommend trying both to see which work better for you.",5.0
708,B00IAT4LNA,"I have interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and vulvar vestibulitis, all of which make me very sensitive to condoms and lubricants. While I do not have a latex allergy, I find that latex condoms irritate my conditions. Additionally, I typically can't tolerate the lubricants that come on condoms, but I could not find a non-latex, non-lubricated condom. After doing some research, I discovered that polyurethane condoms are superior to polyisoprene because they can conduct temperature better and are thinner. I decided to give these a try despite the lubricant and found that I tolerate them very well. My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to ""bare back"" sex than any other condom and I don't have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI's afterward. Also, I can use non-water based lubricants that I find more effective and gentle and not worry about compromising the integrity of the condom. We won't use any other condom now.",5.0
709,B00IAT4LNA,"yay! no kids yet!Aside from that this is as good as it gets.  I've tried many brands and types, this is the one for me.  It's more expensive than latex but it also feels WAY better and doesn't have that horrid latex smell.  There is no smell that comes from using these.",5.0

Anyway, good price and product, prompt delivery and good communication.",5.0

714,B00C8HLJ4O,I really like these. I am a smaller girth so these work well. They are thin so there is more feel. They have never slipped of during intercourse however when you pull out after an unload make sure to hold it from the base to avoid if from slipping off.,5.0
715,B00C8HLJ4O,"These are absolutely fantastic condoms.  It isn't the size that matters, it's how you use it - but you can't use it if you don't get a good fit with protection!  That's where LifeStyles ""Snugger fit"" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up ""averages"" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?  It infuriates me that they don't carry these in stores.  Not everybody has a porn star penis.  Get real.CON:  I didn't like that they arrived in a Ziploc bag.  That was weird.

The Sagami felt a lot better for me.Additionally, I find the Sagami to be of better production quality in several ways:1) The Aoni's lubricant isn't very evenly applied. The head portion is too wet while the base portion is often entirely dry. The Sagami has very even application of lube.2) The thickness of the Aoni seems to be uneven - the head is probably thin enough to be 001 (is it 0012 technically?), but the material seems to increase in thickness toward the base (or so it feels). The Sagami on the other hand is very uniform in thickness and provides very good sensitivity over the entire length.",3.0

I guarantee the moment you pop one of these open, the discussion is going to be ""what is that smell?""  And then it gets on your hands.  And from there, everywhere else.

I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem.

Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don't already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn't recommend that you use these.  You might find out the ""hard?"" way that you don't really need any extra help.",3.0
766,B0070YFJGO,"Never had condoms break before I've tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same ""procedure"", ""preparation"", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.",1.0

I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!",5.0

772,B0073RBUZ2,no babies yet.,5.0
773,B0073RBUZ2,"I refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised.  The packaging looks different even though they say its the same product (ultra thin line of trapan's).  also, even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom I got in a 3 pack from walmart a few weeks ago.  These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....",1.0
774,B0073RBUZ2,"First of all, these are not real US Trojan condoms. They are a knockoff, made in Thailand. When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.",1.0
775,B0073RBUZ2,"Excellent product. After 3 weeks of using them my husband and I have never had one break, but like any condom sometimes a little extra lube is necessary. Overall when you have to use protection I'd never buy a different condom.",5.0

They are still the thinnest I've tried from Trojan and meet all expectations.",5.0
777,B0073RBUZ2,"DO NOT BUY.These are Thai knock-off condoms and not genuine Trojans. They are NOT made in the USA, they are made in Thailand. In addition to that, they are smaller than the average condom, prone to breaking, and the material is not the same quality as a real Trojan. They are clear as glass and feel 'stiff' compared to a real Trojan.Unless you want to uncomfortably conceive a baby during a one night stand, just go to the pharmacy so you know what you're buying.",1.0
778,B00JKDH7WM,"My boyfriend and I had to go back to using condoms because the pill wasn't working out for me. We were hesitant about this brand at first because before I went on the pill we tried so many different brands and there was such a loss of feeling to them, a lot of times he couldn't keep an erection while wearing one. But with this brand, it truly is the closest thing to wearing nothing! It's amazing how much better it feels than a regular condom. We only buy these and Trojan ultra thin condoms now. They are the two best brands on the market if your partner has trouble keeping an erection with a normal condom. Also, we have never had one break so they seem to work just as well. Very happy with them. Give them a try!",5.0

(no pun intended , heheheh), they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful! we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn't come off and it was more of a mood killer.

787,B0073RAL3O,"It may be a bit odd for a woman to rate these, but I have to help encourage men to use them.  I love sex as much as anyone, and keeping safe is VERY key.  These condoms help keep me safe, and feel amazing on my side.  My male partners also really appear to enjoy them a lot too.  No complaints on either end with these great condoms.As an addition, sex is often more enjoyable with some extra lubricant.  I have found that when he is using a condom with ribs, it tends to need some extra lubricant to keep me from getting a bit sore or raw.  I'm just trying to make this a great review and informational for the gents so you keep your lady happy and healthy.  Also keep in mind some ladies have allergies to latex, so never use these with a woman who does.I also want to add that those of you gents who do use lube, that you use water based so as not to cause a condom failure and put everyone at risk.For those of you who explore more non-traditional sex, make sure to take your time, use lots of lube, go slow and lubricate multiple times.  These condoms work well for this too, just take it easy.One last thing, for you gents to remember, these do have an expiration date, so keep them current, keep them handy, and keep some lube with you as well.So gentleman, do the right thing and get some to keep with you, and keep you and your partner safe.  Trust me, your partner will enjoy these greatly!Feel free to ask any questions you may have.Lisa",5.0
788,B0073RAL3O,My wife loves these. Less lubricant than other condoms so there's a bit more friction for her pleasure. Inside it feels like numbing lubricant is present which extends my endurance.

794,B008UYN4QA,"I have been a big fan of Trojan condoms forever, everyone knows of Trojan’s legendary reliability. Trojan ribbed have been my go-to for some time know. I decided to try Bareskin and they do deliver on feel – it is like you are wearing nothing at all. I have had some issues with tearing/breaking, so definitely be careful as you are getting extra feel but losing some strength with the thinner condom. Overall, a good product.

I've used two of them and both have torn at the tip, and I almost didn't notice it in time because it already felt like I wasn't wearing anything. I don't know if there was a quality control issue or what, but I'm not going to be using these ever again, no unwanted babies for this guy!

797,B008UYN4QA,"Yea they're thin for sure and you can feel more while having sex. There is a trade off between thin and strength that people need to be aware of. They do break if you are not careful, and by careful I mean well lubricated. Life pro tip: don't finish inside.",4.0
798,B008UYN4QA,I've used different types of confoms and have never had a problem with one breaking until this type. And it's not just a little split... His penis breaks completely through. So at least we knew. We've tried it 4 different times and they were a brand new box. Would not recommend.,1.0

801,B008UYN4QA,These condoms are basically identical to the Zero Zero Four by Okamoto Okamoto 0.04 Zero Zero Four Condoms 10ea pack . They're both made in Japan and have the same type of font/type face for the expiration date and lot number. I've tried them both and they feel identical to each other. The fit and feel to these condom are exactly the same so if had to make a guess they're both made at the same plant. I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback. I'd suggest any guy or girl that frequents bars or clubs to carry one of these with you when you go out.,5.0

805,B0083HLPLA,"Yup, they're condoms.  If you're unsure about whether you like these specifically I'd suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.",5.0
806,B0083HLPLA,"excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.",5.0

810,B01J939GVC,"This is a good innovation.  There are only three condoms that even come close to this one and I will rank them all in this review: the Trojan Naturalamb Lubricated Condoms, 10ct (packaging may vary), the Lifestyles Skyn Selection Condoms, 24 Count, and the Okamoto Condom 0.03 Platinum Condoms 10p.  The closest comparison is the Okamoto, which supposedly holds the Guinness World Record for being the thinnest.I would rate them as follows:1. LELO Hex2. Okamoto 0.033. Lifestyles SKYN4. NaturalLambThe LELO fits well and does not slip. It seems slightly longer than average, but with an average width.  The sensation is very good.  The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.Both the LELO and the Okamoto are better than the SKYN.  The NaturaLamb probably has the best sensation of any of these, but it is very expensive, fits like a baggie, and does not protect against STIs.I highly recommend the LELO Hex. It is a long-overdue innovation.",5.0
811,B01J939GVC,"Let me start out by saying I am on certain medications that make it difficult to finish what I start - Especially when wearing condoms. The first thing I noticed, was this rolls on like a second skin. The fit is FANTASTIC! I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick. One partner reached multiple Oh's and described a very pleasurable experience with Lelo Hex. The sensations I felt allowed me to get where I wanted to go, too!You wont be dissappointed!",5.0
812,B01J939GVC,"These are the thinnest feeling condoms I have ever worn and feel great. I did not notice any special sensation from the raised inner hexagons and really cannot tell if they are any stronger because of it but there have been no tears so far. It's not the same as going bareback but this is as close as I have found, very happy with these.",5.0
813,B01J939GVC,"These are awesome, ignore the lesbian that for some reason bought these. The condom is extra tight, which works great with the thin hexagonal latex. It seems the hexagons add friction so the condom is actually not moving during sex.",5.0

Condoms are condoms anyway so as long as they do the job, I am ok with any brand -- except small ones, of course. I was hoping to get regular sized condoms and I think that's what I got. I said ""I think"" because I am familiar with all the brands that arrived but not the specific model/variety. I'll be talking more about the brands, too.First off, the condoms came in an (see photo) envelope-sized packaging with bubble wraps inside. So you do not have to worry about receiving a damaged item that may happen during shipping. I like that the package is discreet.Inside, the condoms were packed in another plastic bag that said 'Sold as set, do not separate.' And when opened comes the revelation of which brands were in my package. It felt fun, too. I felt like a kid opening a gift, eager to find out what's inside. I actually just got four varieties of condoms, but just two brands. The condom brands/names were: CautionWear Black Ice, CautionWear PPE, Beyond Seven (orange), Beyond Seven (green). I got six of each, which makes 24. Photos attached (unopened, of course). All styles are lubricated. I was quite pleased to see brands that I recognize and honestly like using and frequently buy: Beyond Seven is a good condom brand in my opinion so I am happy that I got them. Cautionwear is good, too, but I only know of IronGrip variety. I know these brands are unfamiliar to some, but I know my condoms and these brands are good. LOL. Especially Beyond Seven, thin yet reliable.I never use the green one from Beyond Seven so that is something that I am excited about.

So after putting it on you are going to have to go to the bathroom or kitchen to wash your hands with soap, or maybe even kerosene :)))  They stretch (like almost all lifestyles condoms)few moves , and the condom is hanging off like dough.

These feel better, fit better for him(slightly larger, the base is not over tight to be uncomfortable like durex but plenty tight to keep everything inside and no slipping or sliding around), and in the 200 I have not had ANY break. In the same amount of trojan and durex I has several break. I'm very happy with these condoms, would definitely recommend and will continue to purchase more.Also they're red in color.",5.0

I have tried everything from thick'n'ribbed to the thinnest-not-even-there boutique condoms - these are the most reliable and comfortable out of them all. with the thinner ones, i always had trouble with them breaking from getting on it too hard, and obviously the thicker ones feel like your banging a rubber glove. these seem to grab the pros from both spectrums - solid enough to withstand the dirtiest of evenings and smooth enough to make you think wearing condoms aint all that bad.....the pink color is a little off setting tho, but how much time are you going to spend looking at your junk?",5.0
837,B00BISGKJI,"My boyfriend was pretty confused when these arrived. ""You ordered condoms... off AMAZON?""Not much to say about these. They work.

And I haven't been going at a snails pace either.They are very thin.  This makes it somewhat difficult to put on.  As I am trying to unroll it (roll it down?), it frequently gets ""stuck"".  By ""stuck"" i mean that it tries to roll into itself (as if it were rolling back up).  So, in the dark, it can be a tedious process.They are a bit tight.  The extra material at the base is a little uncomfortable, but not unbearable unless maybe you keep it on for an extended period of time. A little difficult to get the condom off afterwards compared to other brands/styles.They actually smell pleasant.  A few of the major brands have some smelly condoms, which is slightly off-putting.  But these aren't noticeable, though if you happen to be up-close to it, it is pleasant.All in all, I probably won't buy again.  Might be better for a less girthy member.  I'll probably just purchase Lifestyles Skyn in the future.  Equal amount of pleasure, but easier to put on and take off, as they are a little larger.",4.0

They are super thin and they are the closest thing to feeling like you are dipping your candle without one.  Knock on wood... I have never had not one rip or tear on me even with rough use.  Remember... I am talking about Durex Extra Sensitive Condoms, not this 2 starred one.",2.0
867,B00C33CVSQ,I really like these. I am a smaller girth so these work well. They are thin so there is more feel. They have never slipped of during intercourse however when you pull out after an unload make sure to hold it from the base to avoid if from slipping off.,5.0

That's where LifeStyles ""Snugger fit"" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up ""averages"" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?  It infuriates me that they don't carry these in stores.  Not everybody has a porn star penis.  Get real.CON:  I didn't like that they arrived in a Ziploc bag.  That was weird.

I recommend it feeling confident that most people who read the description and take price into consideration will be pleased with it. If it exceeds my expectations and is an exceptional value, I put that in the heading. (FYI: Some reviewing sites have told us not to take price into consideration because prices change constantly but to only consider the product as a good or bad product.)*4 stars*: This meets the item description but there is a slight problem. I would buy it again at the right price and would recommend it to others.*3 stars*: This item is off on the item description but is still a good product. I might purchase it again if I could not find a suitable alternative. I probably would not recommend it.*2 stars*: Buyer Beware! There are some major flaws here. Either it is not as advertised or failed to work.

875,B004WDRCTI,"here is my brake down on the reason i got these condoms: i have a 5 months old child and my wife doesn't want to go back on birth control or get an IUD, so i decided to purchase condoms to avoid another pregnancy.i am 33 years old, i do not have pre-ejaculation issues, as i read on here as to why most people purchase them. reason for my selection was because of the extended pleasure as advertised.here are my pros and cons:Pros1. if your someone with PE issues this is a great buy because the lubricant will numb somewhat of your private area.2. if your goal is to last for a very long time this condom will do the trick, i have lasted between 30 to 45 mins none stop.3. great condom to please a woman, due to its extended pleasure you can manage to give ur lady multiple orgasms.Cons1. you can practically last forever at times, sometimes you just want a quick one......might have to purchase another type of condoms...2. condom is made very thick, so u loose sensitivity at times.3. this condom is not good for oral at all, to many chemicals.in conclusion, this condom is great if your unselfish and what to please your woman with multiple orgasm or you have PE issues.....if you are a person that can last like a porn star this would not be a good buy.....lol....",4.0

I haven't had any break, though that has never been a common experience for us either.  The box is discreet, the individual products are very sleek and give a more elegant look.The main reason we buy these, though, is to know that they're cruelty-free.  When I'm able to find a product that is as good or better than the off-the-shelf products at a drug store that has the added bonus of less impact on animals, we try to go that route.

I've tried 7 brands to date, and nothing quite matches up to this one. I will add that I have not tried lambskin as the price points for the better ones don't quite match up with how often my partner and I enjoy having sex.The ONLY reason I can't give it 5 stars is the packaging.  Holy hell ... you're all fired up and try to open up a new box - next thing you know you've got a half-chub and you're still fumbling with the ridiculous plastic wrap that seems to be impossible to open unless you're not in the throes of love making.I could open the box before-hand - which I do - but sometimes you just don't realize you're out.Anyway, love this condom and recommend it to others strongly.",4.0

The bowl comes in a thin (and super jam packed) plastic bowl with four varieties of condoms (Natural Feeling, Pleasure Max, Extra Sensitive, Her Sensation. The picture is deceiving in that it shows a rainbow condom but that was not included in the bowl). I'm not a believer that the condom type makes a huge difference, so the variety didn't really matter to me, but in case you are, each condom is color coded and you can tell what type they are by the black print on the non-colored side of the condom.The condoms themselves are pretty durable. I haven't had one break so far and honestly that's all the matters. So, if you need tons of condoms, this is the product for you.For those who are curious, you'd have to have sex 2.77 times a week in order to use up all these condoms in a year.",5.0

Not really a variety being that there's a total of 144 so i would expect more of an assortment especially since that is what the picture and description displays to you.

912,B002T5L454,"""Life is like a condom fishbowl; you never know what you're going to get"" The packages don't seem to say what the condom type will be (lubed, studded, ultra thin, etc.) so it is always a surprise.",4.0
913,B002T5L454,"Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .  I personally wish they weren't colored but I know that most flavored condoms are. All of them expire at leat three years out from the date I ordered them.  Some don't expire for 4. We are very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying them again.  Though it will probably be a while before we need to!",5.0
914,B002T5L454,Whats going on Durex? I got my first bowl that didn't have a cover. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover. Despite there being a cover on all the pictures on Amazon. So lets call it what it really is a GAME OF 144 PICKUP. You even put it in one of the tipsiest shapes known to man the fishbowl. Maybe you figure many will be lost and you will have quicker reorders. Would the 2 cents for a cover break the bank at Durex?,1.0
915,B00VHPIMJS,My husband and I were really pleased by these. We have recently switched over to Durex rather than Trojan finding that it is a better product for us. We especially liked the variety to choose from. The silver box they come in is so discreet and also very useful because boxes always rip or the condoms are falling out everywhere. Not really helpful if you are trying to hide them from kids. haha!,5.0
916,B00VHPIMJS,"Needed a form of birth control after my son was born that wouldn't effect lactation with hormones...condoms are the simplest choice. My husband was buying these at the store in three packs for a huge markup. I told him I'm too cheap to pay $2 every time we want to use one when there are less expensive options...so I got on Amazon to see the price difference and buy in bulk...so glad I did. These work well, I honestly don't feel much difference between types, my husband says the thinner the better. He has always liked the durex brand best so we stick with it. None have broken and overall, these are more affordable. Here's hoping they do their job and we don't have any surprises too soonWill reorder when we need more.Update: we have been really disappointed with the orange condoms. They are weird and uncomfortable. They made up half our box too.After using these for a while, I have really come to dislike the smell and consider the various chemicals used on them as a problem for me. I mean, I try to be chemical free in everything else, so after a little thought, I decided to opt for a latex condom without chemical lubricants and dyes and fragrance. You can buy these on Amazon too, they are called sustain condoms. They are beautifully packaged, natural and vegan...I'm not vegan, but appreciate the qualifications a vegan product must have...if the chemical load of conventional condoms gets to you too, maybe durex isn't for you either.",5.0

923,B00IMUGVE4,"These are hands down the holy grail of condoms. I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.",5.0

Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).",4.0

So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.",2.0
927,B00IMUGVE4,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.",5.0

It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
930,B00IMUGVE4,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0
931,B00R3UKU64,I used to be a fan of the Thin Magnum but these are now my top choice it really is Thinner than Thin and has a great feel to it.  It says there is less lubricant than normal but if you know what you're doing then that shouldn't be a problem unless your lady has a problem and can't really get wet if so then you probably already have lube handy,5.0
932,B00R3UKU64,"If you've got to wear a condom, this is the one to use.  The BareSkin condoms are utterly amazing.  I've previously only used the Magnum Thin condoms but even they sometimes (maybe even frequently) lead to such a reduction in sensitivity that gladly kills my boner.  Sure, you're always going to know you're wearing a condom but these let me feel everything, seemed to go with the movement, and seemed to be a little looser than other Magnum condoms.  Given how impossibly thin the BareSkin condoms are, the bit of extra wiggle room - whether perceived or actual - probably contributes to its strength.  If a normal sized condom feels snug and you have $8, there's ZERO reason to not try these.  I mean, who says, ""I wish the latex was a little bit thicker.""??",5.0

I'm not sure what women they surveyed to design this, but I sure as hell wasn't one of them. It really is rather boring and actually the design that is supposed to make it better, makes it worse.Average condoms have a thickness of 0.0027"". This condom has the same thickness. This makes no sense. They should have made it thinner to enhance feeling. I love my guys natural texture and with a thick condom, I can't feel that raw man design.The average condom is 7.5"" long. This condom is the same. The reservoir tip is much larger than average condoms. This is the only positive part of the different design. This allows for more ejaculation room and allows it to be possible for you to feel this also. I would not recommend using this condom if you are longer than 7 inches.Average shaft and base width for condoms is 2"". The Her Pleasure condom is the same. This does not accommodate for guys on the thicker side.Average condom head width is 2.125"". This condom has a head width of 2.5"". This provides extra head room, too much actually. The idea behind this was that the extra room would cause heat through friction. This idea may sound cool but it doesn't work. It just bunches and doesn't fell good at all. The only good thing about this is that it provides even MORE room for ejaculate if it is needed.The water based lubrication is average. The latex smell is non existent which is great!

Nonetheless, I hate condoms to the extent where just opening the wrapper made Senor Johnson go back to sleep almost instantaneously.But Senor Johnson approves of these.  They're so thin that you'd think they'd tear easily, but I've never had one of these fail in my life.  They're well lubed without leaving you sliding all over the place, and they don't have that noxious smell that gets progressively worse as bodily fluids get involved.  These are as inoffensive as condoms get.The only problem with them is that they're a bit tight, even by average standards.  For average Joes, that might be a good thing since it's absolutely impossible to slip out of these unless Senor Johnson passes out.

I was happy with the selection I got-- it did include all the brands they listed, 2 or 4 of most kinds and a good handful of Crowns which are probably a cheap filler but good nonetheless.  I was happy that only 2 types of Trojan condoms were included because they have been a disappointment to us in the past. After trying out several kinds we have both figured out what we do and don't like, and once these are gone I can buy our favorites in bulk.  It has been exciting to try out all the different kinds that are new to us such as textured, different sizes, colors, shapes, and even glow in the dark. The only heads-up is that these, like most bulk condoms on Amazon, are shipped loose in a padded envelope.

977,B004HTVNEC,I just received this 100 variety pack in the mail and we're happy with the assortment we got. We normally don't care what kind we use until we find one we like more so than others. We been together several years and don't do it often because of work so these variety packs last us forever. Oh and it says 100 pack I got 100 + 2 + a lube. So I have 0 complaints. Lol,5.0

979,B004HTVNEC,"I read reviews and looked for the best sample package of condoms so my husband and I could try different kinds/brands and see what we both liked best since I am breastfeeding our 4 month old so we don't want to take birth control hormones. This product was what we ended up selecting. It was the best!My experience with the product/seller:-Excellent mixed selection-Several more than the 100 were sent (around 106)-Only took 2 days to arrive-Neatly and discretely packaged in a padded envelope-we have had none tear or malfunction-all were well within dateI was especially appreciative of the sellers customer service. There was one specific type of condom that I had been wanting to try and, of course, with my luck it was not one of the many randomly selected. I emailed the company and they quickly responded back that they would fix the problem. A week later I received a package with the ones I had specifically mentioned inside! (Plus several more kinds over 30 condoms total) They were generous and helpful, I really appreciated it.All in all Yes! I would order this product again and plan to do so as we have found ourselves enjoying not using the same exact type every time but instead having a little variety to suit the mood.

983,B00BISMMZE,"For a latex condom these aren't bad at all. They don't have a latex smell like some of the other brands (Durex and Trojan) do. They're pretty thin and very strong; however they're not as thin as the polyurethane condoms (Sagami) that I have been using the last year and half. Would I recommend these? Sure, for someone wanting an inexpensive yet reliable latex condom they're pretty good. As far as size goes; I'm average in width (55mm) and length; I guess I'm used to using polyurethane condoms that don't stretch and fit snug; something I was hoping would also be the case with these. The base of these holds pretty tight and the shaft is pretty close, but they stretch ALOT and don't hold tight quite like the poly condoms do that dont stretch. These came packaged lose inside a plastic mailing bag; they were doubled (two condoms) per piece; labeled not for retail sale. I was actually surprised to see these as in my mailbox because I had canceled my order; yet someone at CS must have made a mistake and sent them anyway. I'm not complaining, getting a bag chocked full of condoms for free isn't a bad deal. The dates were good till 2020; I opened three of them to see what they looked and felt like and all were nice silky smooth in texture and had no smell.",4.0

I've used Durex ultra sensitive and they felt thinner so I could feel more.I give this product a 4 star because it is advertised as ultra sensitive, but I don't feel any extra sensitivity. It could probably be advertised as normal/regular condoms and people would still buy it.Overall this is a great product.

My order arrived with an expiration date of April 2021, 4.5 years from my order date. I bought some Durex Extra Sensitive last month from the store and they expire in June of 2020, so win there!How do they perform?My girlfriend and I have been using both these and Durex Extra Sensitive (purple box) for several months now. She can't tell a difference. I think the Durex are a little thinner, but the LifeStyles are better lubricated. Both of these are noticeably thinner than everything else we've tried. We use some lube anyway so it was pretty much a tie. I looked up condoms on Consumer Reports and found that the LifeStyles ULTRA SENSITIVE made a perfect score! That's why I ended up going with these. Hard to argue with science and you certainly can't beat this price.",5.0
990,B00BISMMZE,I have used Lifestyles before and they have never disappointed. It is an affordable brand that is practically the same as your Durex or Trojan. It was much cheaper to buy 100 at Ansell Limited than buying even 36 at other vendors on Amazon. They definitely have the best deals around.,5.0

1008,B0045ENSJ2,"My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.",5.0
1009,B0045ENSJ2,"I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.Size:I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.Shape:They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.Lube:The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.",5.0

1011,B0045ENSJ2,"These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.",2.0

I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.",5.0

1014,B00328R398,"I really like these Crown condoms because of their thinness (.04mm) and how well they fit. I would put these slightly above the Durex Extra Sensitive ultra thin condoms 24 pack (Pack of 2). These two condoms are my favorite but these Crown condoms are my #1 choice. And there must be a reason these Crown condoms are the #1 choice of pornstars when they have to use condoms.As for these Crown condoms I was a little cautious about using them at first since they are pretty thin and was worried about them breaking but I've had some pretty intense and rough sex with different women and these have yet to break on me. Also I'm not sure how hung some of the reviewers are complaining about these condoms not fitting but I'm bigger than average with good girth and they fit me really well. So unless you're Lex Steele these condoms are gonna be just fine for 99.9% of users. And for the lucky .1%, there are Magnums and other condoms of that ilk.My only gripe with these condoms is the way they arrive. All 50 condoms are loose and not packaged in a nice little box.P.S. I was lucky enough to win a gag gift basket at a friends bachelor party which included OKAMOTO CONDOMS ZERO ONE 0.01mm 3pcs MADE IN JAPAN - 3Boxes and MY GOD those condoms were AWESOME. It totally feels like you got nothing on. But these .01mm condoms are expensive. I'm sure Amazon has better deals than what these cost.",5.0
1015,B00328R398,"Just to preface, I wasn't super thorough about all of this.I just so happen to have a batch of Crown condoms from years ago. I ordered them from Condom Depot on October 5, 2010. They expired June 2015, and are from batch number T170. December 14, 2015, I ordered the same condom from Amazon. They expire October 2019, and are from batch number T4Y4. I have no guarantee that the old batch was produced in Japan, but there is a slight chance. Condom Depot wrote an article (""Crown Condoms Thailand & Japan What’s The Deal?"") regarding the differences between manufacturing locations, dated March 11, 2009. In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row. So do you think they sold 400,000 condoms in more than 19 months? The odds probably fall in that direction. Anyway, let's see if this unnecessarily thorough review helps anyone!Sensation: The older batch seems to have a slight better sensation to it, but they're both so similar that it is extremely difficult to tell.Thickness: Placing the two, still rolled, side by side, the older batch seems to be ever so slightly thinner. This goes against the article from Condom Depot, as they state those manufactured in Japan are 0.005mm thicker than those made in Thailand. Curious about this, I tried measuring two others that were still in their packaging. Keep in mind that I have a crappy $15 digital caliper, but the old batch came to 3.31mm, and the new batch 3.46mm. I tried not to squish them, so I based my measurements off of how much drag I felt when removing the caliper after measuring.Read more ›",5.0

They do feel more like bare skin than anything else tried, but the light lubrication didn't seem like it was there at all. In fact, it seemed like there wasn't any and with BC pills natural lube isn't always there. So, without the help of a lube bottle these can actually end up hurting both of us because of the dry rub.

1018,B00328R398,"Well, in terms of protection, Crown skinless has always been my go-to brand and style. Next to that, Beyond Sevens, however most people vouch for Crown over Beyond Seven (both produced by the same company, however Crown is featured in many ahem, feature films...)The crown is comfortable, if a little snug for most men. It's also relatively thin, along the lines of .0042 thickness, if I recall correctly. You can get .002 and .002 thickness with other Japanese brands, however the price increases exponentially and the availability decreases as well. Crown is a wonderful go-between, but do be careful regarding the manufacturing locations.Many years ago I purchased them when they were the original silver and blue packaging. They were thin and barely felt like they were there. These new blue and white packets feel thicker to me for some reason, though it could be because I went for a period without the need for condoms, and now that things have changed, it's hard adapting back to the ole latex.I've used MANY of these condoms and have not had one failure. They are only lightly lubricated so make sure things are good to go before going at it or you'll create some heavy friction that's unpleasant for your partner (and bad for the latex). Very little smell on these, which is great, and the pink color almost makes it look invisible, which is another bonus.I am getting used to these, and have almost finished my current 50 pack.

However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.

I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.

We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.

Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.

1057,B00VIJMF7I,Easily the most sensitive condoms I've never used. There are only two things that are not really complaints but just observations. First they are tight and tend to squeeze the head more than I'd like. I think if there was more room in the tip they would feel even better. The other thing is because they are thin I've had one break but I was being overly anxious when putting it on and it ripped at the base but I've never had one break during sex.,5.0

1059,B00HI35HLY,Yes I do have mixed pleasures about these.  Overall they do what they're supposed to.  Which is cover and catch.  Good job team.  They fit a little small which is both good and bad.  The sensitive ones suddenly become super sensitive.  My favorite actually turned out to be the glow in the dark one.  And yes it does work.  open it up first let it collect a little room light while you give your lady a little moonlight. wink wink.  Then strap on.  The small fit does some...lets say extending of time.  And the glow in the dark is actually a little thicker so not quite as sensitive.  All in you will get more bang for your buck...wink wink...nudge nudge...wink wink.,5.0

I will update to let you know our favorites and why.Also in regards to the size issues others have had the issue not the length but girth. Length goes to 8 inches but girth is average to small. Which I like it snug it seems to feel better for both of us. And most people don't know this but a lose condom creates friction which in turn will break.

1070,B007O3CPVS,"When Durex first came out with these condoms they were manufactured under the name Colors & Scents. They first appeared in the Pleasure Pack and were such a hit, they were then manufactured by themselves as Durex Tropical. These condoms are great for their purpose. The smell and taste of latex is horrible,If you love oral and like to switch things up a lot or perhaps sometimes are not able to finish with intercourse and then like to follow up with oral...this is perfect for you. There is no lingering taste or smell of latex to turn you off. This goes for guys or gals. It will make your penis or vagina smell and taste like whichever flavor you used during intercourse.These condoms come in three different flavors and sometimes four if you can find the rare fourth flavor of mint. The most common are strawberry, orange, and banana. These are also colored accordingly as red, orange, and yellow. My favorite is the strawberry. I think this has the best taste and flavor. Orange is next and then banana. This is a personal preference though. The mint green ones are great also.In terms of fit, this is how Durex Tropical compared to other condoms: Average condoms have a thickness of 0.0027"". This condom has a thickness of 0.00247"" which makes it a little thinner than most condoms. This will enhance sensitivity a bit.The average condom is 7.5"" long. This condom is also 7.5"". Because of the reservoir tip being small, this is why I recommend not using it on a penis longer than 7"". There needs to be wiggle and ejaculation room.Average shaft width and base width for condoms is 2"". This condom is smaller at 1.75"". This doesn't accommodate the guys on the thicker side. Keep size in mind. It works better for those with less girth.Read more ›",4.0

1136,B000FQSLE6,"A word of advice to anybody who is interested in these condoms: these are the best condoms I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot.This is the only condom where I more than once thought it fell off to realize that it hadn't, it was just so thin that it felt like you had nothing on.  These are the only condoms that I don't mind putting on.  Let's just say that it can get very dangerous if you're coming up with excuses to not put on a jimmy hat because you don't like the feel.  Yeah, these condoms may be expensive, but consider the upside: you won't mind putting them on, and you could be saving yourself large bills from a disease/pregnancy.Now to the other people who have reviewed this product: are you all porn stars??!  I'll tell you my size to put it in perspective: I'm almost 7"" with above-average girth.  I'm kind of big.  The large condoms fit me fine.  Hell, I'm wearing the normal ones right now, and although the length is a little short, they're still wearable and fit comfortably.  I would take the other reviewers' opinions with a grain of salt as I have had zero issues wearing these.",5.0
1137,B000FQSLE6,"Dude, you can barely feel them... Its like nothing is there... the only kind ill buy son... They are strong, and transfer heat so you feel the good stuff instead of a piece of latex... Buy them... they are a bit more expensive  but well worth the price...",5.0
1138,B000FQSLE6,"The three stars is only because the size of the base ring is much tighter than I expected after doing a lot of research and was expecting it to fit closer to a regular condom (maybe around 54 mm in width) and it was much tighter, and the three stars is not for the quality Sagami condom brand. For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers. For now for the times I use polyurethane condoms I will use the Okamoto 002 Large that fit closer to a regular condom because for me the base ring was too tight on these Sagami 002 Original.",3.0

1141,B000FQSLE6,"Wondrous joy! Thinnest condom on the market (though I've heard of the elusive 0.01mm, but cannot find it)! Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2"" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir. I've read that these condoms are ~1.4"" girth, but up to 2"", you'll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don't work out for you.",5.0

1144,B000I0Y1K2,"Some people say they are allergic to latex and that sends up a red flag to whom ever they may be thinking of having sex with. I am allergic to latex; among other things. I have sensitive skin and it can be a problem. I tried these condoms along with many other non-latex brands and I have to say that these are so much better than all of the rest.One thing I don't like about latex is that it stretches too much. A little stretch is ok, but as the condom stretches, it loses integrity and starts to cut off circulation. Polyurethane stretches too, but it is much stronger than latex, so these condoms are thinner than normal condoms and don't stretch as much, so I actually feel like it is more a part of me. I am able to have sex for long periods without cutting off circulation, or having to change out the condom.When I first tried these, I was sold. My girl (at the time ;-) hated using condoms, but actually liked the feel of these. I will never have sex without condoms again (until I find Mrs. Right of course). I only wish these were available in stores around me. Even if I wasn't allergic to latex, I would use these. If you have not tried this exact product, you have not felt what polyurethane CAN do. The competition's polyurethane condoms are terrible (understatement of the century), so when I hear men bag on polyurethane, I have to say that they never tired this product.I might sound like I own or work for the company here, but I don't. I have been unable to have safe sex comfortably without getting a rash that turns into a yeast infection a day later because of the latex, so I have not been having sex at all. Now that I have found a product that allows me to have sex with any woman I want, you better believe I love this product and it is only fair that I give it the review it deserves.",5.0
1145,B000I0Y1K2,"These are Great!  I've never really liked ANY condom BUT these DON'T have any bad smell too them and they  definately feel better than even the thinner ones but because of the polyurathane they are pretty strong.

I have not had any problem with breakage either.",5.0
1147,B000I0Y1K2,"I think I would have to say that these condoms are better than all latex condoms I've tried.I had to switch to non-latex because of my wife and I can't complain too much. These are much thinner than most ""skin"" condoms and feel stronger than other non latex brands...how that makes sense, idk.My only complaint is that because they are so thin, application is a little more difficult as they do not unroll as easy. Also, taking them off is difficult unless you wait to ""down size"".Other than the above they are great.",5.0
1148,B000I0Y1K2,"I love these things! Sometimes they feel a big too snug, and if you aren't completely erect it's hard to get on due to the tightness. However, once it is on it's an awesome experience. The polyurethane is great because it doesn't stretch out as much, it stays right where it is and enables a more ""natural"" feeling. The only downside to that is that it isn't particularly elastic, so if it does start stretching out a bit (generally from things getting too dry) it doesn't go back to its original shape. Because of this, we'll generally just take it off and throw a fresh one on. But I still prefer it to latex, hands down.If you use this and pair it with a good lubricant (I use Wet Platinum Premium), it's about as close to ""raw"" as your going to get in my experiences. The thinness of it and the material mixed with the tightness and the wetness of the lubricant really simulates the real thing nicely.  If you're in the ""larger"" department down there, don't get this. It's not going to be comfortable. But if you're average, this should do the trick.I spent most of my sex life using birth control, and only recently went back to condoms, and it's hard to ""get into the mood"" when you have to throw one of these on, they reduce the feeling a lot too. But this particular brand has definitely helped getting back into the use of these, highly recommend you give it a shot!",5.0

1150,B000I0Y1K2,"Magnum guys beware! This condom is not made for those guys that have higher than average girth (thickness).I've tried many types of condoms and by far these feel the best because of the great material, but are terrible at the same time so let me explain.The material and almost nothing feel gets five stars and my girl agrees, but these are not made for larger guys.  Actually the only reason I'm giving it low stars is because other guys should be aware.Putting them on is very difficult and even painful if you have some girth, since these aren't latex THEY WILL NOT STRETCH. This means this will be very difficult, time consuming and PAINFUL TO PUT ON. Now down to 2 stars.After you've managed to put it on, good luck.  It will feel good because the condoms are so thin and the material is great, but it is likely to SLIP OFF and it might even be difficult to tell since the material makes if feel like you have nothing on. There's no point of a condom that doesn't stay on.There hopefully will be a magnum version for these one day.Avoid the headache and try a batch of 3 to see if they work for you, but don't get them in large quantities, I've had to give mine out.",2.0

Thin but strong.  Easy to use.  Fit comfortably.  A lot of people think they provide the best sensation on the market.

The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)Definitely go with the Durex extra sensitive on this one.

1209,B00JRG8Q04,"Bought this as a gift.  They'll fit as small as 3"" length by 1"" diameter, and probably even smaller. They fit better than anything else on the shelves, and it was helpful to have a range.  They're safer than the regular sizes (won't slip off) and super nice on the wearer's ego (""snug fit"" sounds better than small).  It also makes a really thoughtful gift for the guy who has trouble finding his size or didn't even realize condoms came in a range of sizes - who doesn't appreciate a personalized gift?",5.0
1210,B00JRG8Q04,"I had ahard time finding condoms that fit me, so i bought these and I am not disappointed at all.for the best hold the iron grip, but you might lose some sensation. Lifestyles feels better but might slip off if you are not careful.",5.0
1211,B00JRG8Q04,"My member is not quite so large and had other condoms seem ""baggy"". But these do indeed fit snug...and feel great. Just be careful to allow for space at head when put on or you might have an overflow ""spillage"" ooze out around the base. But these items fit as advertised and do add to my arousal.",5.0
1212,B00JRG8Q04,"i love these, especially the Iron Grip condoms because i think they are more narrow.  The only downside is that they are all way to long so there is a lot left rolled up at the base.  Something 40% shorter would be a better fit.",5.0

1215,B009729698,"The only reason I ever ordered these condoms was because my girlfriend has a latex allergy. I figured they'd be lame because A) condoms are annoying to begin with, and B) if good condoms could be made from something other than latex, than why is latex the de facto standard for like every condom in the universe?Well, I still don't know the answer to B), but after going through a box of Skyn condoms, I can honestly say that I would use them even if my partner weren't allergic to latex. They feel significantly better than the condoms I've used in the past (Trojans), and they're reliable. As a bonus, buying them here is vastly cheaper, more convenient, and less embarrassing than buying them at Walgreen's. I'd recommend this product to anyone who relies on condoms for birth control with a significant other, latex allergy or not.When I ordered a second box, the seller accidentally put the wrong item in the package. The packing slip showed the correct order, but instead of 50 Skyn condoms there were 50 Snugger Fit condoms, which are made from latex. I contacted the seller through Amazon, explained that the latex condoms were useless to me because of my girlfriend's latex allergy, and requested that the correct item be sent to me as soon as possible.My complaint was filed on Monday night. On Tuesday morning I had a response from the seller, who apologized for the error and said that the correct item was on its way. On Wednesday morning the correct condoms were on my doorstep via Fed Ex. Although I was pretty annoyed when I got the wrong item in the package, the seller's blistering fast customer service and immediate correction have left me with an even higher esteem for the folks who make these condoms.",5.0

Don't listen, Im 7 1/2 and close to two inches in diameter and these roll almost all the way down to the base and don't feel too tight. I don't get the ""plastic bag"" sensation with these.  Ive found normal trojans to be too tight and went with the larger size. These however fit wonderfully. very comfortable, no slippage, almost no odor and they transmit heat well. I really like that they are not slathered in lubricant as well. there is some but not too much.",5.0
1218,B009729698,"I've used over 100 of these (years before their expiration dates) and have never had one break. They work very well for my latex allergy. The seller ""Chubby Dick Emporium"" also delivered in less than a week with free shipping, and provided 4+ years before expiration.",5.0

1220,B009729698,Really impressed with these condoms. Have not used them in nearly a decade so when it came time to pick them up again i was dreading a bit. This is a whole new generation of condom.

1222,B009729698,"I don't typically review my items, but I can't not explain how great these are. Like others here, I bought these condoms because the girl I am seeing is very allergic to latex.

It doesn't roll all the way,but I have never had an issue with them coming up or slipping off. The lack of lubricant is no worry for me, she does that for us ;) I can't believe that latex is the go to when condoms like this are way better. No odor, been through about 200 of then so far without a single hiccup, and no more balloons!!!!!!!I would recommend this condom to anyone who needs to stay away from latex. I also encourage people who don't need to stay away from latex to buy a pack of 3 to at least try them out. Terrific condoms, 5/5",5.0

I'm glad that I bought a small 12 pack to try before jumping into this one and would recommend this to anyone that is considering buying it.

1231,B004N731ZM,"I've used these my entire lifetime. You won't find a better bang for your buck anywhere else with any other product.I've never been a fan of Trojan. Every time I use them I feel very uncomfortable, like they never seem to fit right, or the specified ""effect"" or ""special lubricant"" or whatever never seems to stack up to their claims. To my knowledge i'm not allergic to latex but with trojan condoms I seem to display qualities of a latex allergy without any of the more unpleasant side effects (swelling, inflamation, ect).Being that I didn't know if latex was the problem I decided for the hell of it to try something else and since lamb skin are less effective percentage wise, my friend recommended these to me about 5 years ago. After seeing a commercial I finally gave in and bought a bulk pack of like 12 or whatever, and I haven't bought another brand since.Not only are they extremely comfortable (as far as these type of products go) but they really do simulate the sensation of ""wearing nothing"" better than any other product on the market. Application and removal is a breeze. no bunching, snagging, pinching or any of those unpleasant problems posed by thick latex style products. And best of all they stretch and conform without ever losing their seal. Fantastic product.",5.0
1232,B004N731ZM,"I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction. As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you're ... y'know ... ""oversized,"" you might find these too tight. My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.",5.0
1233,B004N731ZM,"Polyisoprene is extremely superior to latex in sensation and comfort, particularly in temperature transfer. Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice.

Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.",5.0
1234,B004N731ZM,"Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort.- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation.- They have no particular smell or flavour.- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too.I've also tried recently the Durex polyisoprene condoms (“Avanti Bare” or ”Real Feel”, they can't seem to be able to decide on their marketing), but they were more expensive without offering any obvious benefit, so Skyn are the way to go.",5.0

I wouldn't say that it feels like there's nothing there because it still feels like I have something on but I feel my girl a lot more now than before. In other words it feel little bit more natural.Cons: It's a lot tighter on me which can be annoying at times but this WILL vary from person to person.,4.0

1251,B010NB016S,"The female condom is amazing. It is more pleasurable for both the male & female than traditional condoms; and offers more protection against STDS that can be spread by skin to skin contact by covering the outer area of the vagina. The ring that remains out of the vagina adds extra clitoral stimulation and friction during inner course. My boyfriend question if I was really wearing it the first time we used one, because it felt sooo good he couldn't tell. I love that I can put it in before we even begin to mess around - so there is no momentum lost fumbling around for a condom. Plus since they are non latex you can use any lube you want. They are big, which seemed weird at first glance- but once I tried them I was hooked.  I just wish local stores carried them.I have literally given them to all my friends to try. I don't understand why they are not the preferred condom. All my friends who tried them made the switch.",5.0

I find that missionary position works best so you can hold on to the condom. Switching positions didn't work out too well. So for me, once you put it in and start a position, stay in that position if you can. The spermicidal lube really helped the feeling for my spouse. Good luck!",3.0

1261,B001UCA5NO,Thinner than Okamoto Crown and diameter is definitely bigger.  I would compare the size to Skyn Elite (but smaller than Trojan XL Magnum) which I also love even though Elite is much thicker this Sagami 002 large and Skyn Elite is my favorite so far!  Third place would be Durex ultra thin which also has a very pleasant but mostly neutral smell.  Skyn kind of stinks but always seem to work.I will say this poly construction of the Sagami is interesting.  It doesn't stretch much the rubber latex so it feels very stiff putting the condom on.  But I felt more pleasure towards the tip and was afraid it ripped during the intercourse but wasn't so.  Yes it's pricey but I would say if you want the thinnest this is it.  If not Skyn Elite and Durex ultra thin would be my other choice.  The Crown's diameter seemed bit smaller and was too tight for me.Definitely try this one out if you're looking for a VERY thin condom.  I had no problem with the condom ripping or having issues so far.,5.0
1262,B001UCA5NO,"Most natural feeling of the non-latex condoms. And most non-latex condoms feel noticeably better than ANY latex condoms.Note that ""Sagami Original 002"" come in two sizes - regular, which means Asian market, and large, which means well-endowed Asians and average endowed Westerners.  Neither is truly large or extra large in the heroic porn film sense. In terms of actual fit, keep in mind that condoms stretch a lot and you can blow them up like balloons or use them in an emergency to carry water. So, the regular size might feel snug going on and be slightly more difficult to roll down, BUT it's still going to fit and once it's on you can't tell the difference in sizes.So apart from a placebo effect, there probably isn't a condom made that is ""too small"". A little award to roll on, for sure, but not too small.This is important because the ""Large"" Sagami, which I prefer, is twice as expensive as the ""Regular"" Sagami. Who knows why, but that's the case. Also, all the sellers seem to be located overseas. I sure hope someone take the time to officially import these because they are fantastic.",5.0
1263,B001UCA5NO,"Four stars was a difficult rating because of the fit, but given they are not for the US market four stars if a fair rating.  As a product, like others have said the lubrication is great and the feel truly is wonderful, but the sizing can be misleading.  If you have tried something like a Magnum and find yourself to be right in between that and standard, you will most likely find these to be tight.  If you finish rolling down a standard condom and don't have much left, the Sagami will be short.  These don't have the same type of reservoir tip you may be used to, so a short, tight condom could result in bypass leakage.I agree with others that if they made an american fitment (or an XL based on Japanese sizing) they would be my absolute favorite.I don't think numbers or measurements help as well as a comparison and I'm sure if you are considering these you have tried many products.",4.0
1264,B001UCA5NO,"After reading all reviews here, I decided to go with the large version due to larger than usual girth. I was skeptical because I could never wear the american ""magnum"" condoms but the standard size were always a bit tight. I got the package quickly loves how the individual condoms are packaged (no ripping nasty aluminum or plastic with your teeth). These have slight lubrication so no need for more.I truly think that they used my penis as the model for this condom...it was a PERFECT FIT. I barely feel it on my fingers, so thin and strong at same time. Not flexible like latex but still had some give/pull to it. Performance was top notch.In all honesty, I am a repeat bareback offender as I hate the feel of condoms. I bought these as a last resort since the Crowns didn't really do the trick for me. What I loved the most was the really small (almost non-existing) reservoir head. I HATE the look of the deflated reservoir just flapping around at the tip it makes me conscious that the condom IS there, and that defeats the purpose of having a little fun.Its nice to know that in Japan my penis is considered ""Large"" but then again thats not saying much.

After using these, the purple wrapper Durex-es feel like I'm wearing a garden hose.  The Sagami 0.02 feels way better than anything else I've tried.For science: I'm about 5"" around and nowhere near the full unrolled length of the Sagami (now you have something to reference).

If you're one of us that has been frustrated with slippage, BUY THESE!!! you might even find them too tight so I'd recommend getting the 12 count to make sure these are for you.  A lot of folks consider these the snuggest condoms on the market.  I also find the excess length of these on me acts as c-ring, which adds to my pleasure by prolonging climax.  For those of us on the short end of things, these are an awesome choice; good tight fit, lower price and peace of mind when used.

That said I feel very confident that these are genuine and of the same great quality I've come to expect from Lifestyles. I generally need a larger condom and the comfort tip on these accommodate that nicely. They're thin enough that they're not restrictive and though they fit me a little more on the snug side I've been loyal to this brand/style for over ten years and I've yet to break one which is more than I can say for many of the others I've tried. They're offered here at a great value and if you're an average or larger man I'd recommend these!If you're on the smaller side, I'd recommend you try something different as I imagine these might be a struggle to keep on for smaller guys because of the combination of them being on the thinner side and the comfort tip.",5.0

The Trojan ones were really too small and very tight and I don't think very well lubricated. I would absolutely recommend this product if you are trying out condoms, it's a lot cheaper than buying an entire box of something you may not like or doesn't fit well.

1299,B00OM627MW,"Novelty wore off pretty quick. The condoms aren't difficult to ""charge"" up (we used an LED worklight I have, worked just fine). They don't glow very brightly, and the strange irony is that the condom isn't going to be out of certain areas for very long, so we realized pretty quickly the strangeness of using a glowing condom. Latex was really thick, really snug (a bit too snug, and in all modesty, I'm not well-endowed). Girlfriend liked them, can't say the same for myself. No babies, so that's always a plus.

Easy to use, fit is good, transfers heat faster, and way more comfortable for both of us because it is not stiff/rubbery like the others. Comes with great instructions if that is a plus for anyone :) Not sure why people make a big deal out of the smell. I can't even tell unless I put it right up to my nose and even then it is very mild. Highly recommend for you to try! It is way cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I can find. We bought a pack of three at Walgreens to try them before we bought the big pack. The pack of 3 at Walgreens cost over 15 dollars! I couldn't believe it!

We have looked at tons of options but I don't want a vasectomy and neither of us wants her on some jacked up pharmaceutical conconction to prevent birth so we opted for condoms. Disafisfied by how they feel we have tried a ton of them and settled on Skyn because I thought that was as good as it could get. After doing a bit of research online I found these and thought I would give them a try so I went to my local CVS to buy a 3 pack just to give them a go before buying in bulk. We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price. I will never go back to regular condoms. Doesn't protect against STDs but you shouldnt be out screwing some random chick anyways. Take it from someone who has lived both scenes.

1322,B0064FHD5A,"I've used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don't roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a ""choking"" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren't so damn tight. For reference I'm about 8.5"" long and 2"" wide (6.25"" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can't believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don't dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don't feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I'm guessing that's because they are the ""thin"" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you're not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I'd say if you're over about 7"" long or 6"" around (1.75"" wide) you should definitely give these a try.FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn't have a single one rip, so I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I'm guessing since they're the ""thin"" version maybe if you don't have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.",5.0
1323,B0064FHD5A,"You're probably going to try several different brands and types before finding the condom that's best for your situation.  While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried.Trojan has another version in this line called the Trojan Magnum Ecstasy 3 Pack that has the larger Magnum head for more ""wiggle"" room but with a base diameter that's between that of this Magnum Thin and that of Trojan ENZ.  This may be a good alternative if worried about the condom staying securely in place and depending on your situation that might be a good thing.  However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4"" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.  Also, the Magnum Ecstasy version I tried had ""Warming and Tingling, Nonoxynol-9"" that left me feeling disconnected from the experience.This Magnum has a water-based lubricant, protects against both STD's and unwanted pregnancy, and for me, this thin version provides the greatest comfort and intimacy of all the versions I've tried in the Magnum line.  I've never encountered bunching or breaking as reported in a few of the other reviews.  These have never let me down (no pun intended) and work well for my situation.Read more ›",5.0
1324,B0064FHD5A,"Okay, I'd like to be as brief and as helpful as possible. Men who want to know about this product want to know about two things:1.  Can a man with an above average or large penis wear this condom comfortably (aka, without being squeezed to death)? Yes...mostly2.  Is this condom actually thinner?  In other words, can I have pleasurable sex with this thing? Absolutely YESI'm a larger guy who needs a bigger condom.  I've been married for years.  I don't always wear a condom, but when I do, I wear Magnum.  Always.  Magnum is my brand because they don't strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should've been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn't enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it's a little snug at the base....It doesn't seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I'm not going to be the guy who says it feels like there's nothing on.  I mean, let's be honest:  If you're wearing a condom, sex isn't as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: ""Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.""  I thought so as well.  It is definitely thinner, and to put it courteously, fun was had by all.

They sometimes make me forget I'm even wearing one, because of how the fit.So I just ordered these and got them the other day.At first I wasn't sure whether to get them or not, because people say that they arrived in a plastic bag, and that they were not in the original box.After asking some people, I came to the conclusion, that I was gonna get them.I ordered them the 14th, and the estimated delivery time was between the 20th-25th.They were already shipped the 15th, and delivered to my place the 19th!!!First picture is what the envelope looked like, all the blurred boxes are just my personal info. It didn't say anything about condoms or whatever, for the people who prefer the discrete way.Second one you see the condoms, between 2 pieces of cardboard with a pretty decent thickness.

Which I thought was brilliant.And let me not forget to say, that the envelope of course had bubble wrap too.Last one you see all the condoms lined up, they all come in pairs of 2, like they do when you buy them in their original box in a store.And then there was 1 extra one, that was just on its own, which I thought was a little weird? Why not just 24? Why not just 26?. But maybe they had some sort of idea with that, or just adding a little bonus..Ordering condoms online, I was definitely a bit naive. So I went ahead and checked each and every condoms for holes. And of course I didn't find any holes lol.I will definitely reply to any questions you may have, just to be nice to people in doubt, or wondering if these condoms are for them. Because I, was one of those people.",5.0

If you are a guy who loves to raw dog but always feels bad or scared after you hit it with no jimmy, then these are for you.  Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.  I hit the skins at least 4 times a week and I could practically be a spokesperson for these Jimmy's because I've used them so much.",5.0

1344,B00C350E2Y,"I'm giving it 1 star because I'm not sure what I received this time and I need answers. I previously ordered Skyn Large condoms in May 2016 and i fell in love with them. I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India.

1345,B00C350E2Y,"I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.",4.0

1347,B000BK5TVY,"Here's my review, first off, I didn't purchase from Amazon. I got it from condomdepot .com. I purchased a 24 pack ($9.99), googled for a discount, found one at 12% off, and used the free priority shipping.  It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk. I searched for the best price before I purchased, even looked here, and I felt the price there was already pretty good, add the free shipping and the discount and my mine was made.Now as far as use goes, I thought the condom looked smaller than other condoms, but it slipped right on my sweetie with no problems. I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything. I got these condoms for HIM, because I wanted us to be protected but I wanted him to be able to feel as much as possible. I also noticed that there was no latex and sex smell after we were done.Read more ›",5.0

Shipping is also very discrete. I received my package under GHP records and sales company. Something along those lines. Could also be used as a dental dam, (unroll, cut the tip off, and one cut along the condom length wise to get one sheet out of it).  I probably would not recommend for sexual intercourse, maybe as last resort with spermicides(or second contraceptive) along with. They are also colored condoms. I would say 12 flavored condoms for $6 is worth trying if you are into experimenting with safe foreplay/sex.

I also like the bluish tint they have to them it adds to the fun and it's better than the off/dull white that most other condoms have. One of the best things about these that I love is the fit as these are probably the best fitting condoms I've ever tried before. I'm a little over 7"" fully erect and they cover me up just fine without being too restrictive. They are nice and snug border line too snug but just enough to give your member some breathing room which makes me feel safe that it's staying in place and not going anywhere no matter how hard the party gets. For sensitivity I can honestly say that I can't tell I'm wearing one when going at it which makes me not mind using a condom which I like because we all know that using a condom sucks. I can definitely tell the difference between the sheerlon and the regular latex condoms. These sheerlon condoms are smoother and stretch without the restricting feeling of regular latex. I've never had one break on me even when the going was rough and dry. I'm glad I tried these because these are my go to condom for casual encounters and I would probably be paying at least two girls child support and maybe of had a few STD's if I wouldn't have used these.

Moreover, I was very happy with the condoms they sent me. There was no latex smell, it lasted well over an hour without breaking, and the lubricant somehow doesn't get sticky after a while like most condom lubricants do. My wife was actually really happy about it too, since when she went down on me after sex, she didn't have to deal with the latex smell.Highly recommended -- great company, great condoms, great fun for you and your lover!PLEASE NOTE: If you're not sure about your size after reading my review, go to their website and buy their 'size testers' -- it's like $3, and it has 3 different size condoms for you to try so you can figure out which one you should get.

Hormonal birth control works in that it kills my normally healthy sex drive so we often use condoms.My husband can't use regular condoms.  Period.  They are too tight and end up effecting his ability to stay ... well ... effective.  Girth is the issue here rather than the length.  The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9"".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don't seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don't have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you're rolling in the dough.I never had problem like that with past partners and was barely aware of the size of XL.  I finally broke down and researched enough to see if my husband was extra sensitive or extra large as the size indicates.  I learned that the girth size suggested for condoms according to www.condom-sizes.org are as follows:  (measure the girth at the midpoint of the erection):Regular:  girth < 5.3""Magnum:  5.3"" < girth < 5.5""XL:  5.5"" < girth < 5.8""out of luck: 5.8"" < girthMuch to my husband's annoyance, I forced a measurement and found him to have a 6.0"" circumference, average is somewhere around 4.8"".

Shame on them. European brands like ""MySize"", ""TheyFit"" and ""Pasante"" are built with similar quality standards as Trojan and they have much real larger sizes. The problem is that it is very difficult to get them.By the way, compare the Magnum Trojan XL packaging size with another brand.

But, it would be foolish for me to pretend that education in this area is not vitally important to virtually all people.  Though this product does not completely escape cheeky puns & suggestive advertising, I truly believe that this company has honorable intentions and is making a sincere attempt to make a positive difference in the world.Their products are cruelty free & vegan. The L packaging is made from 100% recycled materials & vegetable-based inks.  The Latex is locally sourced, sustainably tapped, and has a 90% reduction in proteins - which means the condoms are thinner, more transparent, and have less of a latex smell and taste.  But most importantly, the company is promoting health to the best of their ability.  Their condoms do not contain harmful chemicals such as spermicides, parabens, casein, and glycerin which are additives that can cause UTIs & yeast infections. Proceeds not only go towards donating condoms to those around the world who normally have no access to contraception, but they also seek to ensure a sustainable and long lasting impact by supporting organizations who train women to become healthcare professionals.  This gives them the opportunity to become independent in their communities which affords them a larger influence in key decision making, such as the actual use of contraception.I feel good about this purchase not only because I know that my money is going to a good cause, but also because they actually work well.  The smell is not nearly as obnoxious as typical Latex condoms (which I hate).

1509,B00C30PNNO,"I first used these for anal penetration, both as the pitcher and the catcher.  As a fairly thick pitcher, these have a tight fit and take a little more effort to get on.  They go a long way in delaying my climax and feel very sturdy.  Never thought I would use ""sturdy"" to describe a condom.  As the catcher, these have almost no smell and are fun to put on my dates.  When I tell them they are extra strength, it seems to give them the go ahead to push harder and deeper knowing there is less risk of breaking inside me.  Of course since it knocks down some of the sensation, some of these guys go until I'm weak and helpless.  As someone who enjoys the company of strangers, these put my mind at ease knowing that there is less risk of catching a social disease and I am free to open myself up to new driving styles.I have also used these for vaginal penetration.  As the wearer, there is less sensation than going bare and even less compared to other condoms.  But when dealing with strangers of all types, you want to know that you are protected and I like the extra security I feel.  The bonus is the giver will last longer, giving you more time together.  So whether you like it anally or vaginally, giving it or taking it, these condoms help your date last longer and give you that extra pinch of assurance so you don't have to worry as much about sharing fluids with that stranger from Craigslist.",5.0

It's almost like it's more thin and watered down and it makes it easier to irritate me than normal.

It feels very smooth on the shaft, and has completely eliminated that rubber-band feel that latex condoms have. It still takes a little longer to ejaculate, but when I do it feels awesome. It is not the same as a Trojan: Bareskin, because it feels different; these are two totally different types of condoms.

The head portion is too wet while the base portion is often entirely dry. The Sagami has very even application of lube.2) The thickness of the Aoni seems to be uneven - the head is probably thin enough to be 001 (is it 0012 technically?), but the material seems to increase in thickness toward the base (or so it feels).

They just feel like almost nothing is on.Main concern with these is how easy they might be to break because of how thin they are but so far even with rough sex, none have broken and they seem well made. These fit a bit tighter than Durex condoms so that might be a concern.Definitely give these a try if you want that almost bareback feel, they seem well made and exceptionally thin and reliable when used properly.",5.0

It wasn't tight either but I imagine if you have a lot of girth it may not fit too well",5.0
1562,B004F0NXBE,"Just received these, so I've only used one. I've mainly been using Crown and Beyond Seven lately. I prefer the Crown; Beyond Seven were just too tight, really seemed to pinch at the base, almost choking. Crown tended to be a slightly better fit, but the lube level was low.The 004 is more like the Crown than the Beyond Seven as far as fit. Snug, but didn't pinch, and length was good. Thin? Yes. Thinner than Crown Skinless? On paper, yes, but in actual use I didn't really notice much of a difference. First thing my wife said, though: ""These don't smell bad at all!"" That was always a deal-breaker for Trojan and even LifeStyles, the latex stench. You couldn't get the smell off your fingers until two or three washings later. Okamoto's lines are definitely better, but even the Crown smelled a little bit. 004 might be a game changer there.  :)Like I said, I've only tried one, but the heat transfer was very good, and the feel was good, as well. Lube level was a bit low again, but wifey didn't need to break out the Wet. If I find anything wrong with these (durability, etc) I'll update this, but as for now I'd probably spring for these over Crowns. I mean, yeah, they're more expensive by double, but I'm married; I'm not using 20 a month (though I'd like to). It's not like they're $10/shot.Do yourself a favor: buy an assortment with these in it, or buy the smallest quantity of them and try them along with Crown Skinless and LifeStyles or Durex Extra Sensitive. Both you and your partner really need to try each of them a few times before making a decision.

Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you.

1581,B00014UIO8,"This is an item that does not get the attention it deserves. While most adults are familiar with male condoms, female condoms are virtually unknown. That is sad, because they are a really good idea. The female condom is a larger verson of the male condom, designed to be inserted into the vagina, and have the male penetrate in the usual fashion. There is a semi-solid but flexible ring at the closed (internal) end that helps keep the female condom in place during sex.As a male, I don't particularly like male condoms. I realize they are good for safe sex, okay but not great for birth control, inexpensive, and widely available. However, they do have some serious limitations. First and foremost, they are not very comfortable. It has been pointed out, accurately IMHO, that male condoms can even be troublesome for men built larger than average, and that includes the larger  condoms. They can be quite uncomfortable, interfere with an erection, and be difficult to put on.Second, they do interfere with sexual pleasure. The male organ, unlike its female counterpart, is far more sensitive to stimulation by friction than by warmth, pressure, or vibration. Male condoms seriously decrease stimulation by friction (which can be great if you need that). The old saw about ""showering in a raincoat"" is not far wrong.The female condom solves both these problems. They are far more comfortable, especially for the ""bigger"" man, and they allow the male to experience the frictional stimulation that works best for him. They also allow the female to have control over the use of the condom, preserve the primary mechanics of stimulation for her as well, and can be far more fun to insert than a male condom is to put on.Read more ›",5.0
1582,B00014UIO8,"I ordered these to try them out. I had seen what I'd say are about 2/3 to 3/4 positive reviews at all the sites I've looked at, and a substantial number of negative reviews, again around 1/4 to 1/3. I knew already that what was pictured here was an FC1, and what is being sold is an FC2--so heads up that packaging is not as pictured (at the time of my purchase), and that's GOOD because you want the FC2, not the FC1. The later version has improvements including that it doesn't make the crinkly bag sound a lot of folks complained about. I had watched the instructional videos about insertion, and also read at the informational sites that you should try it about 3 times with self-insertion (I'm a woman), before you should be getting the hang of inserting them. My partner was very into the idea of inserting it himself, and I had no objection. When I tried on my own at home, I felt very unsure if I'd seated it/secured it as required. But when he did it--also after watching the video online--he nailed it the first time. I wonder if most of the negative reviews are tied to older versions (FC1) or not inserting it properly, because that thing was anchored in there securely and we had no trouble with it moving or coming out. It stayed put exactly as intended, and we did a number of stops and starts with the one we used. For my part of it, I really didn't even notice it. It felt like ""nothing."" At one point we were just laying in bed, and he asked how it felt just laying there with it in. I said I couldn't even notice it. When we removed it, I did feel the tug, which let me know it was in tight while we were using it, and had been inserted properly. For his experience, the jury is still out. He said that it he was having ""more sensations"" than he does with a male condom.Read more ›",5.0

1585,B00014UIO8,"Far better sensation for both partners than with any male condom. Finally we are BOTH happy!  My hubby couldn't even tell a difference in sensation from not using one.  Very slippery to insert and pretty unsexy hanging out, but if you and your partner are both game to try it and can get over that, you will be amazed!  The male has to make sure to aim appropriately into the ring, or it obviously can't do its job.  So, you have to re-aim every time he comes completely out. If you don't check, it is easy to slip around it and be outside without knowing it.I have a history of vaginismus, which is very painful during sex. These condoms have helped a lot. I feel the pleasure but not the pain. Hallelujah!They have been the best solution for us.  My hubby hates male condoms, I hate hormonal treatments, and we weren't ready for anything permanent.Remember to twist (so the contents don't spill) and then pull when you remove it.Product arrived quickly and discretely in an unmarked box and wrapped in white paper that was  shrunk wrapped in plastic.",5.0

No bad smells and never had a problem with the lube. They also come in a really nice container with a little carrying tin IF you buy them elsewhere (the one time I got them here they just came loose in mailer).Though by far my biggest complaint is there is only one tear notch on the round package and for whatever reason in the dark in the heat of the moment can be a little difficult to find. I wish it had 2-4 little notches spread out so you have an easier chance to get one. I've fumbled around a few times with these which is annoying, but for the most part it isn't a huge issue just they clearly did it for design and not function.

1613,B000JNY74S,"Price much better on Amazon than in local stores.These are really an amazing product.  You just need to get over the weird/""ugly"" factor... (forgive my use of guy and girl in here... just interchange with whatever you prefer, please.)PROs1.  They are not tight on the guy.  I feel like every guy I have discussed condoms with will say ""They are too tight"" or ""I can't/never use condoms"" or ""I can't stay hard with condoms"".  I get that.  I am sure they feel weird and unnatural and desensitizing.  These, however, are not at all tight on the guy. Enough said.2.  They cover more area on the girl.  OK a condom leaves some part of the base of the shaft exposed and allows skin/fluid contact there.  (Sorry, just saying).  This covers more area from the girl side, so in theory, if used carefully, could ELIMINATE skin/fluid contact there.3.  For a guy with any type of erectile dysfunction/ED who is interested in safer sex ... try this!!! The whole condom application/timing thing can kill a tricky erection.  And if your erection doesn't get super duper hard... condom application can be hard.  These eliminate these issues.  If it's hard enough to use, it's hard enough to use with these.4. This particular type (with the orange and purple package) comes with enough of whatever lubrication that they can be used without more.  And no smell/taste issues I've noticed.CONS1.  Price.  They are more expensive.2.  Weird.  You have to put in the smaller ring sort of like a diaphragm or the old ""sponge""... kind of fold and get in past pubic bone... you need to be comfortable with this to use these.

1615,B000JNY74S,"I have no clue why these are not the best selling condom in the world. My boyfriend says he can't even tell I am wearing it.

I love that I can put it in before we even mess around so there is no momentum lost between foreplay and the main event. It's non latex which is great for me since I have a latex sensitivity.

The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower.

They are more like a hint of flavor -which I like-  without any ""plastic"" or weird taste.  Excellent for oral sex and finishing without a mess. My husband and I love them.",5.0
1664,B00C6NU4VY,"These do what they're designed for. My wife isn't necessarily crazy about all the flavors, but they smell great.

I had discussed it with my girlfriend and we decided to go with these but you would expect to get 2 of each flavor but instead you get a random number of each. Even then, the ""flavors"" are more like scents, good scents but there's no taste to them. I guess its a flavor for your partner's nose...a condom for nose holes. I wouldn't know what else to compare it to since I haven't tried any other brands with ""flavors""",3.0

There is nothing worse than having your condom fall off!  They also do not have a strong smell, and they do not make my penis smell bad either, which I have experienced with other condoms.The only downside of these is that they do not have a lot of lubricant on them, so you may need some additional lubricant if there is not enough available naturally.",5.0

The package arrived quickly and was very discreet - it was in a yellow bubble wrap envelope with no identifying information on it. I'm not embarrassed about buying condoms, but I still appreciate the discretion. The expiration dates were several years into the future, which was very reassuring, since in the back of my mind I thought that maybe they were so cheap because they were about to expire, but that definitely wasn't the case. I haven't had a single breakage/issue with any of them, and I will definitely be reordering soon (unless I can convince my husband to have a vasectomy, which would be awesome.)

Then after a 12 year relationship without condom use , I'm back on the dating scene .

They are, of course, more expensive than mainstream brands, but not ridiculously so, and 10% of profits go to support women's health initiatives, so that's nice. The lack of chemicals and spermicides mean almost no odor. Also nice.The packaging is a little odd. Make sure you take the tape off the boxes before getting frisky, or you'll risk killing the mood. I like the spa-style pictures on the wrappers. Very relaxing. And don't miss the instruction booklet, a mini-homage to The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making.As for the condoms themselves. . .they're fine. As others have mentioned, they run a bit on the small side, but not so much as to be an issue unless you're packing King Kong in your boxers.

As some reviewers have noted, the condoms fit a bit snugly, but I have no issues with the fit and actually prefer a snug fit for both, comfort and sensitivity.

These Sustain condoms are made without any harmful chemicals, designed with all natural materials and lubrication. The manufacturer also donates a portion of profits to women's health initiatives. For anyone truly concerned about their health and the health of their partner it is a good idea to choose natural condoms like these.

I lost a lot of sensation while using it, to a point where I got frustrated and took it off. It left my skin dry.

There is a good amount of lube at the tip which means that during sex, the tip slides around more freely which replicates the sensation of condomless sex. These are thinner than the Crown Skinless Skin Condoms that are pretty popular.Bottom line: These give you the best ""bang"" for your buck ;)",5.0
1715,B00BTUEYD4,"I used my Ex's Amazon account bought these condoms to try it out. It was a pleasant surprise how good these are compared with the cost. These came with bulk package without the original boxes, but quality seems to be fine as each individual packing is marked manufactured in Japan, so it is probably better than some other brand that is moved to China or Thailand for manufacturing. I have tried Okamoto Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's and Okamoto Latex 0.03's.  The 0.01 is the best at a cost of $3.5 each and I truly can't feel the condom when it is on. I almost just about cannot feel the existence of the 0.02 and 0.03 either, both at about $1.5 each. These Kimono at about $0.40 a piece and feels almost as good as the Okamoto 0.03 with all the condoms I tried so far. Many people feel Kimono is on the small side, and that is really nothing we can do about it, but I am average size and feel it is good enough, specially the thinness make you almost forget it is on anyway. But the Aqua Lube does feel different to other general lubes although it is not bad.For the Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's, now these are really really thin and small and very difficult to put it on, because they lack the stretch-ability of latex, so don't think Kimono Micro Thin is difficult to put it on. Even at that, once Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's are on and warmed up, they feel great, really like nothing is there. Based on what I know, Kimono Micro Thin Aqua Lube is 0.044 mm thick, Okamoto 0.03 is acutally 0.038, and the Polyurethane 0.01 is 0.018 thick and 002 is 0.028 thick, all in mm. Sagami have similar product like Okamoto but they are all similar in price and thickness, so I assume they feel similar. Chinese Aoni has a 0.01 Latex material condom that is actually 0.036mm in thickness at about $1.50 a piece on Amazon that I haven't tried. So overall, I feel these Kimono are good enough and have the best value out there.",5.0

Heat transfer, feeling, etc, it's almost shocking how much of a difference only .02mm difference makes.I will add that these condoms are horribly overpriced, but I was curious to try them out and I will definitely be looking for a way to source these more cheaply. May even be daring and try for .01's, but that's pushing it pretty far.Size L is actually just regular size, it's comparable to crown size, but because it's not latex, it's less stretchable. However, it held up quite nicely, had no smell (and very little lube). The packaging it comes in is very chic, and each condom come wrapped in a nice plastic container, similar to daily disposable contacts. These are definitely premium condoms and look the part. Huge fan now!",5.0

1745,B000H7FBR8,"I've used 13 of these, one broke, I didn't notice but she did.Length is 7.48"", diameter is 1.5"", I just received second box of large ones but I think next time I'll be getting regular size (6.69""X1.42""). Trojan ENZ are 7.5""X2"" but those are latex, elastic, stretchable, Sagami are not, or not so much, they're either gonna be too tight or too loose, if you're lucky they'll fit you perfectly.Thickness of these are 0.02mm, the reason they're so thin is because they are made of polyurethane, the closest latex condom thickness are Okamoto's 003 at 0.03mm, 004 at 0.04mm, Kimono MicroThin and Trojan Bareskin at 0.045mm. Trojan Supra are made of polyurethane also but they're at 0.04mm thick, rather go latex, fits better. Latex at this thickness has more chances to break than polyurethane, most latex condoms are around 0.07mm thick.For some reason these get harder to unroll as you go down the shaft, almost like the material is stuck together.",4.0

1761,B00IAT4LNA,"No joke, great condoms.  I have tried the Durex, Lifestyles and many many other brands of rubbers over the last 16 yrs or so.  These are very good, and will feel like your condom broke, but they never do.... super strong.ProGreat feeling,Super tight fit, so no accidental pull offFits all sizes, I am on the very large girth size and use large condoms because of this, but these even in regular are super tight, and add to the don't feel like I'm using them feeling,No smellHeat transfer.... you will feel all the heat and sensation you lose with latex.Cons:Need lube for these, seem to be without lube, even though they are lubed, if issue get lube or use the extra lube ones.Can be tough to put on, take your time and because they are rolled so tight, make sure you check to see if its rolled under its self this will cause it to stop rolling down, just roll up a little and back down, or use lube before you start rolling.Super tight can because of this can cause 1. super sensitivity and will make you finish faster, 2. must pinch tip, because condom will not move during sex, and this can cause issues when finishing up.Over all one of my favorites in condoms.  Love how they feel, love the fact that they don't move during sex, and use these over latex anytime.  This and the fact that they are SUPER strong,and if you have allergies these are a MUST in any brand.",4.0
1762,B00IAT4LNA,"If they fit for you, they're the best non-latex condom you can get.  Polyurethane doesn't have much stretch so they're going to feel a bit tighter; that said, the feeling is a lot better.  I'd say if your member is on the low range of the suggested size for a Trojan magnum, then that's the maximum size then these will fit for you comfortably.The good: It's probably the closest to not wearing a condom feel you can get.  This was an issue the first few times I used them because I thought it slipped off.  I've never had an issue with slippage though.  Heat transfer is great.  It's thin so you'll feel a lot more.The bad: They don't roll incredibly easy compared to other condoms.  Practice with one before the first time you're with your partner to save some embarrassment.  I also wish there was a better reservoir tip; breakage hasn't been an issue but a better tip would be nice.  They are tight due to being polyurethane; it's really a personal preference if they're too tight for you.If you're in the market for a non-latex condom your two best options are these and Lifestyles Skyn.  I recommend trying both to see which work better for you.",5.0
1763,B00IAT4LNA,"I have interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and vulvar vestibulitis, all of which make me very sensitive to condoms and lubricants. While I do not have a latex allergy, I find that latex condoms irritate my conditions. Additionally, I typically can't tolerate the lubricants that come on condoms, but I could not find a non-latex, non-lubricated condom. After doing some research, I discovered that polyurethane condoms are superior to polyisoprene because they can conduct temperature better and are thinner. I decided to give these a try despite the lubricant and found that I tolerate them very well. My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to ""bare back"" sex than any other condom and I don't have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI's afterward. Also, I can use non-water based lubricants that I find more effective and gentle and not worry about compromising the integrity of the condom. We won't use any other condom now.",5.0

1790,B0009AHF1S,"Durex extra sensitive condoms are undoubtedly one of the most popular condoms in the World. There is no way one can go wrong with these condoms. They have been credited as being super thin which enhances balminess while at the same time performing their duty of protection.  Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.Sex is a pleasurable moment and when a condom insinuates otherwise then there is a problem. Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.With such an impressive track record and good reputation, Durex extra sensitive condoms are one of the safest condoms out there. Any company that takes Research and Development into account is not only in the business for money. It actually means that they strive for excellence and distinction in providing its customers with the best of the best.Read more ›",5.0

Let me tell you why.My girl is sensitive to the latex(esp. trojans) so I have stopped using that brand for a while although the bare skin one was okay.Even though this condom is latex, it was odd that my girlfriend didn't even react to it. She's very sensitive to latex and it irritates her VJ while making it dry but this one didn't even get to that problem.I certainly enjoy using this condom due to many reasons.PRO- It is very thin!!! It is not as thin is Sagami .01mm but thin enough to feel the heat transfer from my girlfriend's VJ- Nicely lubed compared to Skyn and few other brands- It feels like doing raw a bit but ofc, RAW is always the best with the partner you trust.- Fits nicely, little on the tight side but I don't mind it- My girlfriend doesn't react to this latex condom at all!!!- There are thinner condoms out there but this beats their price(vs. Sagami)- Durability is outstandingCON- Can be thinner(sorry for being too greedy) I would like it SUPER THIN if it can be put into production- I seem to be ejaculating a little faster compared to other condoms(also maybe b/c my girl is squeezing more since she feels it more)Nothing really for CON.

1829,B009SMWCO8,Okay so I received this in the mail and when I open the package the box was crushed. I was thinking to myself that OK as long as they are not damaged that I would be fine. I got to using a few of them so far five out of the 10. Every single one of them broke and my girlfriend was not happy about that so I do not recommend buying these unless you want an unwanted pregnancy,1.0
1830,B009SMWCO8,"It's a good pack to try out some of the different ones but the only ones I noticed a difference with was the Her Pleasure Ecstasy, and I believe the Charged. We didn't try the Bare Skin by boyfriend said that those are too small and make it un-pleasurable. The packaging was a bag so the box to them got a bit damaged.",3.0
1831,B009SMWCO8,"I think it is safe to assume there have been more reviews concerning smell.  It smells really unpleasant, but they seem to do the job.

1832,B009SMWCO8,"First impressions were not good at all. Our personal favorite in this box was the Bare Skin. The feeling was much better than the others. On top of that, the rest of the condoms had a nasty odor that really could foul up some romantic times..... You never want to hear ""ew, what is that smell"".The only reason I rated this with 2 stars is because we did like the Bare Skin ones. Unfortunately, there were only 2 in the box.If you do not mind nasty smells, by all means get this. Perhaps they were old?",2.0

1835,B009SMWCO8,"I love Trojan condoms, it's the only brand my boyfriend and I use, but we were slightly disappointed with the box. Mainly because we didn't get any of the charged condoms and only two of the bare skin. However we got 6 of the  ecstasy condoms which is one of the more common and cheaper Trojan condoms. I would have liked to at least get some charged condoms in the box and less of the ecstasy.",4.0

Highly recommended :)",5.0

1849,B007S0BBLW,"These are amazingly cheap, I've used hundreds of them over several years and never had a break. They are tight, bordering on uncomfortably so.

The package is slippery, which isn't great. Overall these are pretty solid",4.0
1850,B004GZ7VXO,These work well. Tingly. I am pretty big... not huge but 50 percent of condoms I try break yet this has never broken. They feel pretty nice.... I hate condoms yet these are purfectly accetable. The main downfall is they don't have a lot of lube. Just be prepared with some lube on the side.,5.0
1851,B004GZ7VXO,"These Trojan Fire & Ice condoms definitely live up to their reputation in terms of the tingling sensation promised.  As a man, it's actually quite pleasurable and does seem to lead to a more intense climax.  Unfortunately I feel that something isn't quite right with the fit of the condom itself.  I would describe these condoms as feeling ""baggy"", and the ring at the base does not fit as snugly as most condoms.  This gave a feel that the condom was constantly slipping during sex.  I have never experienced this issue with other condoms, and I've tried many different brands, including other Trojans.  I would say I am average (or slightly above) in size, and usually condoms tend to feel slightly snug.  This is the first condom I've used that felt loose.  I don't know if this is intentional due to the special lubrication, but it was worrisome during sex.For my partner, she didn't especially enjoy using these condoms.  I don't think the sensation was that strong for her, and she even commented that the smell of the condoms was somewhat off-putting (i.e., the latex smell).Overall I do enjoy using these condoms, but I don't plan to purchase them again.  If I am looking for a similar sensation, I will use another brand of condoms in conjunction with a separate stimulating product.",3.0
1852,B004GZ7VXO,"Don't let the ""Fire and Ice"" label on the box question the quality of the condoms. I was afraid that this was going to have an ""ICY HOT"" effect, but it didn't. Truthfully, I thought these condoms held more heat than other Trojan brands. It also didn't feel or smell ""rubbery"" either. I would recommend this product to other people.",4.0
1853,B004GZ7VXO,"These are by far my favorite condoms and I've pretty much tried them all. The lubricant gives a nice sensation for me, my boyfriend doesn't notice anything, but I don't thing its meant for him, more for the partner its used on. So I would give these a go for sure, and we've also never had any problems with them breaking or any other mishaps so they're great.",5.0

1862,B0196ANGLY,"I love it! Tried Crown and Trojan Bareskin brands right before this. Wow, there is noticeable difference in thickness. I thought Crown thickness was nice but too tight. Aoni feels even thinner than Crown but actually stretches to a perfect form-fitting feeling, as they say, ""snug"", as if it was made just for my penis shape. The only gripe I have is the lubricant is too fragrant, although very nice to smell, like an apple or honeysuckle, but it's too distracting. But I do like the amount of lubricant, very nice, enough to cover the entire surface of the rolled out condom. I think I found my new favorite condom brand!",5.0
1863,B0196ANGLY,I received this balloon animal making kit. I found the wide opening at the base of the balloons difficult to blow them up and hold air. Also  they have a very slick texture and the balloon kept sliding in and out of my hands and mouth I could not get  a good grip on them until finally the big moment came. I was able to get the first few twists in but then they cam undone so I ended up making a balloon sword instead but it looked more like a giant man part instead for some reason. Oh well maybe I should not try this by myself and get my husband to help me later with testing this product.just kiddinghe had a little bit of a difficult time rolling this on it would not unroll as easy as others we tried.TAB ASLOT BREPEAT they work..... a little dry we added lube worked as condoms should. I'm not pregnant. My only quarry is with this condom and all others his helmet has a ridge that sticks up that I rather like and the tube shape of most condoms flattens that. So though these feel very natural skin to skin almost it does not allow for his shape to be his shape but we knew that going in. Maybe a suggestion for future products The helmeted hero design :-)I received these for s discount in exchange for my blatantly honest and now slightly embarrassed opinion.,4.0
1864,B0196ANGLY,"I'm not getting any younger, and need something with a bit more sensitivity than my usual Trojan Magnum XL.  Unfortunately these are much smaller than Magnum XL, despite the XL designation, and so are almost impossible to put on in the normal way.  Alternative is to partially unroll over two fingers from each hand, and then stretch it out and put on, slip out fingers, and unroll the rest.The sensitive is pretty good - noticeable improvement over Magnum Bareskin and big improvement over Magnum XL.The lube is also great - very thin and long lasting.  One partner liked the taste, the but another thought it numbed her tongue.I will probably continue to carry both these and Magnum Bareskin in my kit, and use the Bareskin when there isn't time to fuss over putting it on, and Aoni XL when things are more leisurely.",4.0
1865,B0196ANGLY,"Bought these and they're hard to get on and too small though they're labeled large. I'm a above average guy but not gargantuan. To make matters worse, in addition to being tight, these broke on the first use. Breakage happens sometimes so I didn't totally discount them but out of four, two of these broke. Threw the rest out as they're not worth the risk and worry. Definitely won't buy again. If you're above average in length and/or girth try the sagami large 002; I've used these awhile and they're pretty good especially if you put a drop or two of lubricant inside.",1.0
1866,B0196ANGLY," They feel better than other condoms during sex, definitely thin. Kinda hard to unroll on because they are so thin and it gets caught in itself while unrolling it down, if you know what I mean. I am 8 inches long and 5.8 inches circumference. I emailed the company and they said they were 54mm wide. I dont know about that because Trojan Magnums are 54mm wide, and these were not the same size as a Magnum for sure. They weren't an uncomfortable fit but they could release and XXL size and they may be perfect. But I am a fan and these will be my go-to condoms from now on. Interchanging with a Trojan Magnum every so often, but the Aoni will be #1 because I prefer the feeling lol.",4.0
1867,B0196ANGLY,great product hard to put on like most of the views say but once on its good to go..

Despite being wrapped as if for children (Initially I thought they had mistakenly sent me a variety multi-pack but each was the same, just uniquely wrapped with a different humorous cartoon on it). They do seem to work though! Plenty of space at the head and not too snug along the shaft. Not loose either, so no worries of it falling off! So far used two of them and happy with results ;)Those of you with a thick bit of meat might find what you need with them.",4.0

It's nothing like Trojan wrappers that you can get it undone in your pocket with 2 fingers. These are horrible if you're in the heat of things and being a not so good looking guy, time is our biggest asset. So if you spend time fumbling around trying to get the wrapper open, it might be just give her enough time to compose herself, get logical and say ""I think i should just go home, i'm tired blah blah""PRO: Great condom itself.

My husband works in a hospital and after an accidental needle stick condoms became a necessity until he was done with the precautionary 6 months of bloodwork.I did my research and found One The Legend condoms. I checked out the reviews here on amazon and figured for the price they were worth a shot.  I'm glad I took a chance because these are the only condoms that have worked for us. My husband found them to be comfortable and he said there was enough room in the base and the head of the condom (which was his biggest complaint about other brands). They fit well, worked well and didn't cause a single issue in our sex life. They served their purpose for the 6 months they were needed and if they are ever needed again, this is definitely the brand I would continue to buy. I've recommended them to all of my girlfriends who have the same condom issues with their SOs as I had with mine and they all have thanked me continuously for the recommendation.If you are well endowed then these are probably the best condom for you.",5.0

1912,B00BI0BGTA,"If you have a long member, but not a thick member, these will fit you fine. These are literally NO wider than a normal condom. Why? Because the FDA regulates condoms. If you want a truly wider condom, try Torjan Magnums. They are the same width at the base, but they are flared at the head which helps. Add a couple drops of lube inside of the condom for your added pleasure.If you are struggling over the red ring of death, the struggle is real. If you're losing sensation, sensitivity, or losing your erection because the condom is too tight, there are other options for condoms. There is a company called TheyFit. They're in England, but they are completely worth every single penny spent.If anything in this review hits home, please google /r/bdp. There is a community there that has a plethora of information for you. Don't risk STDs/STIs and/or pregnancy over condom use. It doesn't have to be uncomfortable. It can actually be enjoyable.As to why the FDA regulates condom sizes:It's done with good intentions. Condoms are regulated medical devices, so each regulator (the FDA in the US) specifies the standard of testing that every condom available for a US citizen to purchase in the US must satisfy. That's a great thing, and should be applauded. However.. the way the FDA specifies its testing (related to another body called the ASTM) means that only certain sizes are cleared for sale: length minimum 160mm, and nominal width 47-57mm (until 2008 this was 50-54mm, which is why Magnum is 54mm). Now in Europe, the medical regulator does exactly the same - dictates what tests any condom must pass before being allowed for sale to a European citizen (there are 500,000,000 people in Europe!).Read more ›",1.0

They're perfect for a plastic adult toy.  But, just not well-made for well endowed men. They are skimpy on the lubricant, and worst of all they they're thicker than a Trojiin.  Just be prepared to have all circulation and sensitivity cut off! (I.e. Get choked below)Final Thoughts: Buy these XXL's if you don't want to feel anything.",1.0
1914,B00BI0BGTA,"I recently went on a camping trip and when the time came I was flattered when this condom was handed to me.  However, the truth of the matter is this is a longer condom than I need.  Still, I'm glad to tell you about it because I've now tried it and condom reviews on Amazon often seem to be more about the reviewer's ego or are otherwise comprised of ""I hate it/I love it"" comments without necessarily explaining why.To begin, a lot of the reviewers for this product compare this condom to Trojan Magnums and that's not really an apples-to-apples comparison.  I've tried every variety of Trojan Magnum and have some expertise with this brand.  The Magnum Thins are my preferred in the Magnum line-up for width (diameter) comfort and I highly recommend them if width is your primary reason in looking for a larger size condom.  However, the most comfortable condom I've found for width is the 10-pack of My Size Condoms 69mm (2.7 Inches).The more appropriate size comparison in terms of the Trojan and Durex brands are between this Durex XXL and the Trojan Magnum XL, while the more appropriate size comparison to the Trojan Magnum is the Durex Performax Intense.  I know it stands to reason that if the Trojan Magnum is big, the Trojan Magnum XL is going to be even bigger, but that's only true in terms of length, not width.  There isn't a Durex condom that is  direct comparison to the Trojan Magnum Thin.  Here's a chart for comparison:Length Diameter Width* Circumference *The width is the condom's base ring measurement9.25 L  1.35 D 2.12 W 4.Read more ›",5.0
1915,B00BI0BGTA,"compared to other brands having large sized C, this seems to be an L rather than XL/XXL.but what made me throw them away, was the fact they feel pretty ""dry"" vs all other brands i've used.even when used with lube, they tend to get stickier, rather than slippy..",1.0
1916,B00BI0BGTA,"Condoms are prone to poor packaging and advertising problems.  Meaning, what size the actual prophylactic is...may not be reflected in the hype or claims.  This is a longer than average but still average girth condom.  Length, stretched out with nothing in it is 8.75 inches by my primitive wooden ruler measure. Nominal, flat width is 2 inches across. Barely. Circumference, which is the size around the entire thing using the base ring cut off then snipped to measure is 4.5 inches.This is fine for average, as average circumference supposedly ranges from 4.2 to 5.1"" however because this is a decent amount of stretch...that means if you are larger than 4.5"" around that it will start to bite into you slowly but surely. Your tolerance may be greater than mine. Your size may be greater than mine.  But 4.5"" around is pretty much the typical circumference range for any condom you can get for free at a clinic. Lifestyles, Trojaneze, One...all of them. That much I've measured.So, it ain't no XXL anything.",1.0

I haven't used KYNG condoms from any other source and don't know how reliable they are, but I haven't heard anyone else complain about them. I've used the Lifestyles XL line without troubles in the past. Either Lifestyles' quality control has dropped tremendously or this seller has a tainted/damaged product. It is shameful to sell this product as contraception. Trust me, a baby is a lot more expensive than even the most fancy condom. No more low-bid jimmy caps for me.",1.0

So why handicap yourself with protection that feels like you grabbed your local grocery bag and taped in in your dingle? So you might say that the uber thin ones are the way to go, feeling over protection right? WRONG! Who wants to be worried about if something is working? That is where these babies, pun intended, come in. Have the best durability and the wife says that next to nothing have been the best feeling for her. I say if it makes me better in the bedroom, park, or wherever we are getting down why should I complain as long as our gametes don't meet.The tertiary thing is that they are also the best feeling for me while offering great protection. There are a few out there that have felt a litlle better but we had a few of those bust, so next time it was on my mind so much it made my pasta over cooked of you know what I mean.The added bonus is these are not latex so allergy minded people are in the clear",5.0

1956,B00ZCMDOUE,"I have successfully been using male contraceptives (condoms) for over 10 years and have tried a variety of different condom brands, here are my two cents:My conclusion: Trojan makes the best ""overall"" condoms. Here's why:Packaging: The outer cardboard packaging is nothing special, but solid enough to keep the inner cargo safe. Once out of the box, by gently squeezing the center of the individual condom packaging, you immediately appreciate the durable individual condom packaging. This packaging allows for safer transport, protecting the integrity of the condom.Features: Honestly, I don't really notice ""much"" difference between these condoms, but I prefer to get this variety pack because there is a small enough difference in feeling to keep things more interesting for myself. All of the varieties are well lubricated (all the way down the condom, unlike other brands) and have different ribbed features. The Intense, is really ribbed, as expected. There are no noticeable feeling differences that I or my female partner have really noticed. The Warming condom is really luby and kind of gross to touch and tastes gross (so I have been told).Performance: I have never had a Trojan condom break and I have had several condoms break during proper usage.PRICE: This is the main reason that I am leaving this review -- YOU, this exact same pack costs $28 at CVS, no joke! If you are looking for an affordable way to have safer sex with your partner, look no further and take control of your sexual health, this is a great product at a great price!Note: There is a review from a female consumer stating that the Warming condom felt uncomfortable. Communicate with your partner -- if there is a problem, stop. Even if you take out the 6 Warming condoms, you are looking at $0.45 a condom vs. $0.77 at other retailers for this product, so it's still a great deal!",5.0
1957,B00ZCMDOUE,"Review for the warming condom - For all the girls out there, it feels like you're on fire. this is literally the worst and such a waste of money! my boyfriend didn't feel anything, but i had to stop after like 30 seconds because it hurt so so much. Horrible.",1.0
1958,B00ZCMDOUE,"The ""warming"" condom is 8 inches long including the tip and about 7.75 inches not including the tip. It's two inches in diameter. The condom wasn't that bad but it has a strong latex smell.",4.0

1960,B00BH4GC8W,As a man that is well endowed the right size condom ensures that you (a) do not bust out and (b) do have your member go blue during sex.  Magnum is for that type of person.  Beyond that it is nice that Magnum has finally started making condoms in quantity that allow me to feel more.  These condoms are great because I no longer feel like I am using a rubber glove while having sex and I still have the protection of Trojan that it will not break.,5.0

1964,B00BH4GC8W,I had to write this review as I hope it does not happen to anyone else.While using these condoms ( I have bought Trojan products in the past and never had a problem but never online) she ended up bleeding during sex.

2013,B009SMY7WI,They are solid condoms and feel great and have the bonus protection from pregnancy provided by the spermicide.

2017,B009SMY7WI,"I bought these because they were ultra thin, and I was looking for more of a ""barely-there"" feeling. While these condoms are super-thin, and did provide increased sensitivity, they contain spermicide (Nonoxynol-9), which some people have adverse reactions to.IF you are one of those people, the adverse reactions are excruciating. I was about 30 seconds into intercourse with my girlfriend, and the tip of my penis started to feel irritated. After 10 seconds of it progressively getting worse, I pulled out and removed the condom immediately. After about 5-10 minutes, the irritation subsided and I thought I was OK.I woke up 3 hours later to pee. The burning sensation that I experienced was incredibly painful. It happened again when I peed in the morning. Almost unbearable, and only just at the tip. Nowhere else did I feel pain.After a bit of online research, it turns out this is a fairly common problem with the Nonoxynol-9 spermicide. It is known to cause incredible pain at the tip of the urethra for some males (and possibly some side effects for women; google it).There are some men that have used it for years with no problems. But I wanted to share my experience because I would not wish this pain upon anyone. It was truly awful.If you have been using Nonoxynol-9 with no adverse side effects... I'd rate their comfort a 3/5 because they fit OK. They were a little snug, but the tightness was not a problem.I'd rate them a 4/5 for reliability because I didn't have one break (but I only used 6 of them before I had my issue; then I threw the rest away). I used the first 5 without any issues.And a 4/5 for sensitivity because I did feel they provided more sensation than other regular-thickness condoms I've previously used.",1.0

2020,B004TTXA3W,"I recently had to start using condoms because our prior method of birth control was no longer available.  I have tried Trojan Magnums and Magnum Ecstasy (I also tried regular size first but they were too small, so I won't review them).  The Ecstasy ones were just awful.  Worst sex I've ever had in my life.  You can read that review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RIA1GHP046SA9 .  The regular Magnums fit fine and were ok, but still too thick for me to get enough sensation to climax.  I was worried that my sex life was ruined.  Then I tried these because I read good things about them.  LIFE SAVED!  Sex with these on feels MUCH better than with latex.  It feels almost exactly like going bareback. I was able to climax just as easily as with no condom, and my wife said they felt good too.  They are also really strong and stretchable. I opened one up just to see how strong they are and it was pretty hard to tear.  It mostly just stretched to whatever size I stretched it.  I had to put my fingernails into it to get it to finally tear, so I'm confident these things will be reliable and I don't have to worry with them.  I don't see how they could possibly tear from sex.  I highly recommend you try these, even if you're happy with your current brand.  Polyisoprene is the best!  Latex is yesterday's news, IMO.",5.0
2021,B004TTXA3W,"Almost every other 'large' condom has been painfully tight at the base. Those that weren't, were instead so thick that they were greatly desensitizing. Some terrible few even boasted both flaws. Previously, the one exception was the Trojan Naturalamb, but that smelled like what it was.So, my partner and I ultimately gave up on condoms and used a combination of withdrawal and rhythm method to ensure that I pulled out whenever she was fertile. Worked for 10 years at a rate of 4-9 times a month. But lately, her cycle has become less reliable due to job stress, my awareness of ejaculation less consistent, and our willingness to forego the experience of sharing an orgasm less steadfast, so we've opted to return to condoms, in hope that 10 years of nanoscale science have seen some improvements in their design.Sure have.These things blow away all the other Trojan, Durex, and LifeStyles products I've tried. They're a bit long for me and end up bunching up at the base, but at last a condom both wide enough to be comfortable and thin enough to let me feel most of what I would feel without it. They're a tad desensitizing, of course, but only a bit more than the famously non-desensitizing Naturalamb, and only on the lower half of penis, which doesn't house many pleasure receptors to begin with. The upper 3 to 4 inches feel not only bare, but sometimes better than bare--whether because of the stark contrast with the slightly desensitized base or because of some 'pouching' happening at the head, I don't know, but it's fantastic.",5.0

My consensus is that if you're girth is from 4.75-5.75 these condoms will fit very comfortably without loss in sensitivity, if you're under 4.75 they'll be a little baggy and if you're over 6 they'll be pretty darn tight.",5.0

2040,B00B4E00G0,"Needed a form of birth control after my son was born that wouldn't effect lactation with hormones...condoms are the simplest choice. My husband was buying these at the store in three packs for a huge markup. I told him I'm too cheap to pay $2 every time we want to use one when there are less expensive options...so I got on Amazon to see the price difference and buy in bulk...so glad I did. These work well, I honestly don't feel much difference between types, my husband says the thinner the better. He has always liked the durex brand best so we stick with it. None have broken and overall, these are more affordable. Here's hoping they do their job and we don't have any surprises too soonWill reorder when we need more.Update: we have been really disappointed with the orange condoms. They are weird and uncomfortable. They made up half our box too.After using these for a while, I have really come to dislike the smell and consider the various chemicals used on them as a problem for me. I mean, I try to be chemical free in everything else, so after a little thought, I decided to opt for a latex condom without chemical lubricants and dyes and fragrance. You can buy these on Amazon too, they are called sustain condoms. They are beautifully packaged, natural and vegan...I'm not vegan, but appreciate the qualifications a vegan product must have...if the chemical load of conventional condoms gets to you too, maybe durex isn't for you either.",5.0

Glyde caused the same thiing but if we wiped off the lubrication the reaction did not happen at all. This method did not work with the other brands.

We have tried the Naturalamb (our favorite, but expensive),  The Supra (Nice condom, it just didn't work for us, didn't feel right, fit right) and the regular Magnums (horrendous compared to premium alternatives). In addition we have sampled many non-Trojan brands (which we found to mostly be a waste of time as Trojan provides an extensive line of exceptional products. We have used literally hundreds of these, so I feel fairly confident in offering this detailed and subjective review.First off this is the most comfortable latex condom I've ever worn. Period. For informational purposes my penis is 7in length x 6.5in circumference. This fits me skin tight and having a snug form fitting condom is essential for the ""barely there"" sensation.  I cannot stress this enough, fitment is key regardless of the condom brand, type or gimmick.These fit very snug at the base (some men don't like that). However, I do like that because it means we can get crazy and wild and not worry about the condom pulling off.  I hate checking the condom every five seconds to make sure it's still on, it destroys the intimacy.  I have never had this condom slip off, even when I'm not at peak performance. I've grown to trust it and sex has become a much more worry free, and intimate, activity.  If the snugness is your only issue I recommend a couple of practice runs without the pressure of pleasuring your partner.  When I first started using these they would smother my erection.

They fit really well on my 7 inch dildo that has 5.25 inches in full girth. If your partner is worried about size, these condoms will fit well.The tantric designs are really cool. I wish it was more pronounced but other than that, they feel pretty good. I like that the eastern philosophy on sex has inspired One Condoms to make their own line of pleasurable condoms. The one thing I've noticed, is that Canada, European countries, and countries in Asian regions are very fascinated by sex. America has some open minded people but American culture is still scared of everything that's sexual.People should really relax and learn to accept that sex is a natural thing. Sex should be enjoyable for both partners.The condom distribution is what I expected. Not completely even, but it's a nice variety of 3 different condoms and designs.

2121,B001GASKUA,"Some time around 2009 they stopped making these in Japan, and moved manufacturing to Thailand. Old stock is difficult, if not impossible to find, and delivery from Amazon dealers has yielded only the newer variety. While they claim that the condoms are the same, it is very clear that they are not. The Thai version is visibly more opaque and looks thicker (though the company swears that they are actually thinner now). More importantly they feel much thicker, and smell just a little bit more of latex. While the old Japanese version was incredible and a joy to use, the new Thai condoms feel very much like the desensitizing thick hunks of rubber you'll find in a truck stock rest room, only to be used as a last depressing and disappointing resort. Basically, any reviews before 2010 are probably of the old stock condoms, and are thus out of date. Extra points do go to these condoms for being very cheap as they are on par with anything you'll find at a grocery store-- but no better. It pains me to say it, but please don't buy these condoms until they return to their previous standards of greatness.",3.0
2122,B001GASKUA,"So there is not to much to say about a condom but I am giving it a go. Let me first start by saying that I have used a couple so far and non have broken yet. YAY! BUT, They do have a horrible smell once you open them. (yes I know they are rubber) But most condoms do not have weird rubbery generic rubbery smells. Next, they seem to leave me feeling ""dry"" They require A LOT of lube or they give me a burning feeling. (it does go away after a few hours) My husband says rubber burn. HAHAHA. Overall I can not complain to much since they are doing there job and not breaking while being used but I have definitely used ones that have felt and smelled much better, I probably will not buy these again and I would not recommend them. After all, most of us are using them for enjoyment so buy some that you will enjoy!!",3.0
2123,B001GASKUA,"I've tried a lot of other ""thin"" condoms that promises that they are the ""closest thing to nothing at all"" and this is by far the best condom in the market. It is very thin, it doesn't break, and the size is not large, but also not impossibly tight.I was never a huge fan of condoms, but this one, is the first one, that I don't mind using it.I would say the sensation is like 85% similar to not using a condom, this is very good compared to the other ""thin"" condoms that I've tried, which gave me like 50-60% of the sensation. Although is not like not using nothing at all, it's very very close to it.",5.0
2124,B001GASKUA,"A friend recommended these to me, so my girlfriend and I decided to try them out. According to her, they feel A LOT thinner than even the Ultra Thin Trojan condoms. While I have had many trojan condoms break, these Crown condoms have never broken on me yet. This, and the fact that they are less than half the price per condom of Trojans, makes them my new condom of choice. The condoms I received came in blue plastic sleeves, instead of the foil sleeve pictured, and I definitely prefer the plastic sleeves. They are far more durable than the foil ones, and are easier to slide into my wallet or bag.",5.0
2125,B001GASKUA,"Super thin, but super durable. I've used plenty of other condom brands, but this is by far my favorite.

2126,B001GASKUA,"Very good condoms, it seems like these condoms are little bit tighter than your regular condoms. Even though these condoms are advertised as regular condoms, they are definitely tighter than regular condoms. If you have average girth then don't worry too much, these will be great. These will be great if you have girth of 4.6 - 4.8 - which is basically average girth size range.",4.0
2127,B001GASKUA,I've never had a condom break on me until I tried this one. Not a good feeling once you take it off. Definitely do not buy these. They weren't even really very thin compared to some others that Okamoto seems to make.,1.0

These are very thin, tight fitting, great feeling, and I have yet to have a single break.With that said, they are tight fitting and they are not particularly well lubricated.  Make sure she is well lubricated, either by putting in some effort or by buying a lubricant.  If not, the form-fit ends up being a discomfort and you may possibly encounter some ripping.  I haven't, because I take care of business and make sure she's good to go.  So should you.  Get these.",5.0
2129,B007A56XBI,"These condoms are awesome.  I purchase these online as I was tired of spending tons of money locally for Trojans which I cannot stand.  I do prefer Durex but the prices are so expensive at CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart.  This condoms feel like nothing is there and they are perfectly lubricated.  Personally, I do not care for the container but the condoms feel great.  My bf and I tried these out and have no complaints what so ever.  These condoms make it easy to be sexually responsible and have fun.  Also, ladies these condoms cause no irritation whatsoever like other brands such as Lifestyle or Trojans.",5.0

But that is a given with any condom. The two ends pop off to form a small ""travel tin"" that holds a couple of condoms. I was not too impressed with this as it is pretty bulky to carry condoms around in, like in your pocket. It would be handy to throw in a backpack or purse or something though. I did find that it had a tendency to pop apart so it would be best to be kept in a pocket in a backpack or something where it won't move a lot and pop open.",5.0

The problem is they feel so good that you don't know when they break, and they will. Plan b my be in your future as it was for me a couple of times. BUT, IF you're on the large side, but not like a coke can they will fit you like no other condom does.

When I found these however, I of course proceeded to order a big old bunch!  Ironically enough, we only used them once (we were both tested before we took the plunge) but the one we did use fit his girthy member just perfectly!Thank you SKYN for making a large sized, non-latex condom and for realizing that even those of us who like our men on the larger end of the penile spectrum have latex sensitivities too. :)",5.0

2140,B00R6UV0FG,"First of all, I have never used these for sexual intercourse, only covering dildos, so I have no experience wearing them or how my partners feel about wearing them. I use condoms on my toys for several reasons, chiefly to prolong their life and to make cleanup easiest, but also because sometimes toys only come in latex, to which I'm allergic; plus I discovered that these condoms are durable enough to leave on the toy for several uses--just wash up, dry, and store as usual. Obviously you should NEVER reuse a condom for prevention of pregnancy or disease transmission, but it's been a boon to be able to use each condom 1-5 times as a toy cover. The surface texture of most toys gets tackier as they age, so a smooth condom is also highly welcome for comfort; and these condoms are even better and stretchier than polyurethane. They DO break more easily than polyurethane, but so does latex; and these condoms don't feel or sound like plastic bags.",5.0

Not only were they cheap (5 for $1) but we also both thought they were the best ones that we'd tried. Then, sadly, it seems they were discontinued, and whatever brand PP uses now sucks. They are thick and rubbery and leave him feeling almost no sensation. Neither of us liked them, and we threw out the rest of the bag. We then went back to using Lifestyles Ultra Thins, which we had used before finding PP's, and they were okay - definitely the best for us out of the usual drugstore types that we'd tried, but we weren't in love with them. So, when we went shopping one day and saw these, we picked some up to try. We have a new favorite! As soon as I was putting it on him, I could tell that it felt way better, thinner, than other condoms, and he said that it almost felt as if he was bare the whole time. We can't compare side by side, but they are at least as good as our old PP ones, and probably better. I mean, it's still a condom, but it's definitely one of the best if you need to use them.",5.0

It really feels like wearing nothing; of course you can't get that direct ""wet"" feeling when compared with not wearing.  But you do become more sensitive and know how slippery your partner gets than the traditional condoms.Not too large to be loose if you are like 8"" - 10"" long and decent thickness (doesn't have to super thick), you will fit well.  If I knew these Kimono LARGE is this comfortable, I would have ditched SKYN or other thin ones years ago.  BTW, there're websites that compare the thickness of most popular brands.

I was getting really frustrated & even thought he was doing it on purpose for that ""feeling"". We tried different kinds from drug stores & gas stations but always the same result....So I googled ""condoms for small men"" and I found these and the Iron Grip so I ordered 12 of each. We have not had one come off since then!! He said he never had any to fit so well & I can actually relax & enjoy him without worrying. I'm online ordering more right now.",5.0
2192,B003JNQ49Q,Very very tight fit and not enough lubricant. We ended up having to take the condom off after just a few minutes in. I of course had to spend half of 46 dollars on a plan b pill the next day. DON'T BUY!!!,1.0
2193,B003JNQ49Q,This is by far the best fitting condom I've ever used! I'm slightly below average when it comes to length and girth; and you can actually feel the tighter fit. I've only had it slide off once during some particularly rough sex. This is all I'll buy from now on.,5.0

2200,B00K4C6MFQ,"So wearing these is mixed feeling on my part. According to my partner, condomless sex= 10/10, male condom sex= 3/10, and female condom sex=7/10. So he liked them when we tried them. ON THE OTHER HAND, I could not stop laughing over how awkward it felt wearing one. It really was like a little ziploc bag hanging between my legs. Very much a 'just get over here and don't look at me'. They don't come packaged with enough lube, but you can just add more and I like that they're nitrile so I can use coconut oil. A lot of synth oils bother me but the lube on these didn't. It is a tiny bit difficult to get it to stay in and not twist around, but inserting it is easy and keeping track of it is just a necessity. Would I use them all the time? No. But do I prefer them to male condoms? Yes. However, whoever says putting them in can be sexy or you can put them in 20 minutes before having sex is full of it, haha. Unless you enjoy the baggie look.",4.0
2201,B00K4C6MFQ,"We tried these because condoms are too small on my partner, but this felt like a garabage bag was between us. I am a petite woman. 5' at 105 pounds.  I found the inner ring to be way too large in diameter.  During intercourse there seemed to be too much latex even though my partner is well endowed.  This had so many positive reviews I was excited, but I can't use them as they make for uncomfortable sex.  I could see it working for me if they made a small size.",2.0
2202,B00K4C6MFQ,Product arrived on time and as described. If your new to this I suggest buying a high quality natural lubricant and practicing. Insertion is similar to that of nuvaring. If your using this as your only method of contraception I suggest using spermacide in addition to the fc2. I use this in conjunction with the mirena iud for sti protection and am very happy with this alternative. My partner and I have an open relationship and as you all know (or I hope) you must use condoms or female condoms to prevent potential infections-- which cannot be provided by birth control alone.,5.0
2203,B00K4C6MFQ,"Hard to be discrete about this product review.  Fits securely but neither partner feels it too much.  Much more comfortable for both partners than a male condom and no lub needed.

Can't recommend highly enough.More pricey, but worth it.",5.0
2204,B00K4C6MFQ,I was baffled by the design but willing to try these. The insertion part was definitely different however my partner was willing to help so that added a little more intimacy.

When I felt the inside of it, the inner ring was just sort of sitting there and I assumed a guy would be able to feel it since it's a pretty big ring and made of a harder plastic. Maybe I was doing it wrong, or it's not for petite women? I'll be sticking to the regular condoms. :)",2.0
2206,B00K4C6MFQ,"Tried them for the first time and both of us were pleased with the comfort of these female condoms. The first insertion of the condom is a bit awkward, and the part that remains outside is a bit strange. The sensation is very different than with male condoms, however. His is increased and friction is non-existent for her. Might be difficult to use for quickies unless she is warmed up prior to putting the condom inside the vagina.With regular use, this product will become much less awkward for us. I plan to stock up!",5.0

2209,B001O02C10,"Positives:These condoms are a great option for people with a latex allergy at a reasonable price.They are almost tasteless and odorless protection.They work just as well on penises as with strap-ons or magic wands.They are relatively thin and don't block sensation too much.The main downsides worth noting:They are snug and a little difficult to roll, particularly off of toys. Girthier penises would likely be squeezed too much.Not quite as thin as the thinnest latex condoms out there - for people who have a hard time staying aroused, this may make arousal and orgasm slightly more difficult. There aren't a ton of latex-free condoms out there though, and this is one of the better options.",5.0

2280,B00GR84C9E,"First things first.  These “large” condoms are very noticeably smaller than Trojan Magnums, or even Trojan Ultra Pleasure, in length and, more importantly, in girth.  (See the attached pic.)  This may be a bug or a feature for the obvious reasons.  The base doesn’t taper quite so much as the Magnum either.The condoms, though, are blessedly not so gunk covered as most condoms.  The feel, etc. is good once you get the condom on, which can be a bit of a hassle since: (1) it is curiously difficult to determine whether they are pointed in the right direction, and (2) it is also curiously difficult to keep air out of the tip.Disclosure: I received a complimentary box of condoms from the seller.",3.0
2281,B00GR84C9E,"There aren't a lot of options for larger condoms. What is out there, well I'm not a huge fan of the names. Magnum - that's a 357 that Clint Eastwood used to shoot people, not something I like to imagine when I'm covering up me and putting it in somebody that I love, or want to love. Magnum, a great big bottle of Champagne, well that's closer to something I might consider. Trojan - wasn't that a horse where soldiers hid and once they were inside, they got out and pillaged the castle? Sounds kind of leaky.L - now that's a pretty wonderful name. Phonetically it is the French word for her - Elle. I like that, this is going to cover something up that will go inside her - well it could go inside him - Lui, not far off L.Large - how simple does that get? No need to wonder, it is large, not jumbo or XL. And there's no need to flaunt the size - L puts the size in small letters just below their logo - L. Yeah Magnums kind of advertise that you are using something bigger.Do you need large? Get out your ruler. There's no need to do that silly flexible tape measure, string thing. Just grab any old ruler, get hard, put the ruler underneath and look at how wide you are. If you're much over 2 inches wide, quarter inch is wider - then use large. If you're 2 inches or less, then use the regular size. Don't worry about length for condoms, that doesn't matter at all.This isn't about size matters and feeling more manly buying a bigger condom, this is about getting something that fits right. Comfort for you. If the condom rolls on easily and doesn't squeeze you tightly, you'll wear one and it will feel good. If you are too small, the condom could slip off. Here's the problem with that - it will probably slip off someplace where it is very hard to get back.Read more ›",5.0
2282,B00GR84C9E,"I was privileged enough to receive samples from L. for the Large, Classic and Ultra Thin.  All of which are great products, and just serve a different purpose. I must say after testing all of them my favorite by far are the Ultra Thin as it's true it really feels like nothing is there. I would compare these Large with the Magnum's from Trojan. However I like the feel better of these from L. for one all of Trojan's seem to be over lubricated and that is never good, as well as the scent/taste I've been told are horrible on the Trojan's. Whereas with L.'s condoms you have no taste at all and no scent so nothing but greatness in those departments.Then if you take the time to check out their website or read the back of the boxes. You will see the Philanthropic work that L. does and it's absolutely amazing. For every condom sold they give a condom to someone in a country that has horrible outbreaks of AID's. Doing this helps control the situation and they also teach safe sex and the importance of using a contraceptive in these foreign countries. So not only are you getting a quality product but you know you are helping make a difference in the world one condom at a time.I did receive these condoms at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.",5.0
2283,B00GR84C9E,On my husband's account. I bought these for us to try a non toxic version of condoms but the the large size is misleading. These were very tight at the base to the point we couldn't use it. If you are truly large and can only use large sized condoms then do not buy these. For reference we use Skyn Condoms in Large.,2.0
2284,B00GR84C9E,"The philanthropic goals of the company are very respectable. Controlling birth rates helps out developing countries immensely and lowers poverty rates. The large version gives adequate room for actions without the fear of breaking or lessened pleasure from discomfort. The packaging of individual condoms is also very strong so low fear of puncture when storing. Only reason why I cannot give it five stars is because when I received my package the main box the condoms came in was damaged and open. The condom roll was loose in package. Not exactly sure what happened, but for paying premium I don't think there the box should have come opened. An open box of condoms is particularly concerning since I don't know whether or not it has been tampered with or it was just damaged in shipping. Very risky knowing the consequences...I inspected it nothing is visible wrong under light, and we're being vigilant. Otherwise good experiences all around.",4.0

Highly recommend. Enjoy!!",5.0
2428,B00KERSR8G,"This is for 2, 12 ct packs of Trojan Pleasures - Extended Pleasure lubricated latex condoms. The condoms have a climax control lubricant on the inside with a special numbing additive (Benzocaine) to help prolong the bedroom experience.These condoms will help keep your man going and going.Works just as you'd expect, although sometimes a little TOO well ;) The numbness sometimes makes it hard for my husband to finish, though I haven't noticed any numbing sensation on my end as other reviewers have reported.",4.0
2429,B00KERSR8G,"Do you give 5 stars or 1 star when a product works TOO well?These do what they say, and then some.For the most part I really don't issues with control, but I got these for when the wife and I wanted to go the extra mile.  Quite often that extra mile turned into a marathon, most without me finishing.  These numb almost to the point where I could barely feel anything down there.  I recently tried another brand's equivalent and was much happier with the results.If you're a guy with some serious ejaculation control issues these will definitely help.  If you just want to add a few more minutes to your performance, these are probably overkill.  I believe Trojan could market these as Extreme Climax Control, and market another set with half the concentration of the formula they use as a simple Extended Pleasure line or something similar.Pros:  Good condom, works as advertised.Cons:  Works a little too well.",3.0

Awesome product would recommend just a tip tho: put it on a minute or two before u go in KUZ it takes a minute to kick In.

They are truly just lightly lubricated, but I prefer that so they aren't so messy when you put them on. Sensation is about what you'd expect, there are definitely thicker ones out there, but there are thinner ones too. We have used about 10 of these so far and all of them have passed the ""water test"" afterwards. Really for the price and quantity it's hard to beat them as they're comfortable and my wife likes them. Crown is the only other that I'd put with this as far as being a good condom for a great price. I wish I would have known about these sooner as it would have saved us a lot of money.",4.0

The lube was also thick and creamy, not clear like normal. Something was seriously wrong with these condoms. Expired, rotten, exposed- I don't know. They were disgusting.

There's no real taste, just a sort of slight cool feeling vaguely reminiscent of mint. Even that doesn't last long, and within a minute it's just straight rubber.On the bright side, they are slightly larger than regular flavoured condoms, which is a huge relief considering normal sized tend to cut off the circulation on my fiance and leave a painful red ring after. These didn't leave so much of a ring, but that's still better than nothing considering they don't make flavoured in his size.All in all, they're sort of alright, but over all just... meh.",3.0

For someone who likes to fornicate at the very least once daily, this is quite the problem.When my partner and I tried one of these out of Trojan Pleasure Pack Lubricated,12-count (which includes, sadly, only two of these), I was of course sore from a previous session. I was quite surprised to perceive that upon entry, the pain was gone. Completely. Fire & Ice condoms relieve my sore vagina similar to the way IcyHot relieves [external] muscle pain.  We no longer have to use an incredible amount of lube!I would describe the sensation as cool (not icy cold) and tingly. My partner says that he felt a warming sensation after a couple minutes; this sensation was barely noticeable to me. Conversely, he did not feel my cooling sensation.I have also found that these condoms can prolong my orgasm!The only downside is that they can get rather expensive. We prefer the variety pack for a better value. A tingling lubricant, however, may be more cost-effective.",4.0

I would buy it again at the right price and would recommend it to others.*3 stars*: This item is off on the item description but is still a good product.

The Bareskin non-latex have been a winner for me. They do fit a bit tight and can be a bit daunting to put on. I've went through a few trying to figure out which side is up, but figured out that if I slow down and pay attention to how it comes out of the package it isn't a problem.

These did smell a tiny bit, now I am thinking about it, and on an averaged sized guy, would likely work out well, if not great. Certainly good for those with latex allergies.

2640,B00WPW4DQI,"I have previously reviewed the regular Ultrathin 001. In short, it's a darn good product with terrific sensitivity, a bit better than the Trojan Ultrathin. It also fit a little tighter than other condoms, and, according to the female perspective, ""smells nice"". My positive review said that the condoms were premium products but wondered if it was worth the high price. I also thought that the people who would pay the premium price for the incremental sensitivity would be the playing crowd with frequently changing partners.This leads me to the other half of the package. The Nanosilver is, even more so than the regular Ultrathin 001, solidly a product aimed at the customer segment with multiple partners. It is basically the same as the Ultrathin 001 in every aspect, except that it has ""nanosilver"" added. I believe the nanosilver is colloidal silver. Some reviewers commented that it was a spermicide. I don't believe that is the case. The silver is there to kill germs. Look up colloidal silver, and you can see that the purported function of the silver is its ability to disrupt the microbes and stop them from reproducing. I would imagine the risk of catching something is the number one concern for people who frequently change partners or get together with unknown partners. For that reason, I think it is worth price for those particular customers. For other customer segments, they will be well served by the regular Ultrathin 001.I hope this review is helpful to your purchase decision (please give me a yes vote if you agree!)

They come with lube already applied on both sides which is nice.  Honestly, getting used to them was hard, because of a couple of reasons.  First, off, because they are so thin, they are little more difficult to peel downwards.  It helps to use two hands.  Secondly, I kept thinking the condom was broken because it felt so close!  Overall, this is my new favorite condom.  They never broke on me, and I'm pretty girthy.

The condom goes on a bit tight, but the way it feels is amazing.The regular ultra thin is awesome. It appears to be very strong and hold up very well through rigorous work.

When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it's not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don't expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.The Nanosilver this is basically the regular condom with what seems to be spermicide. It feels no different than the other to me, but maybe someone wants extra protection.Overall, I had a very pleasant experience with these condoms. I think they are well made and feel great.

On the good side it does make you go longer so if that's a problem, then this is a worthwhile thing to try.On the other side the benzociane dulls even further the pleasure which is already dulled by wearing the condom in the first place.  I guess the best way I can describe it is if your tool had fallen asleep.  Kind of the numbing, tingling feeling you get when your foot falls asleep.  Very different.  I certainly cannot say I had any problem with them breaking.

I cannot comment on the length comparison of it being the longest on the market but i will say that it is a very long condom. its about a foot long maybe longer, and the diameter is larger too. if the regular durex condoms feel tight for you like they do for me then this is one worth trying. I ordered some to try out along with my usual bulk order of Durex condoms and will probably be ordering a large quantity of these when it comes time to restock my drawer. they are not studded or ribbed which is the only drawback to them, and they are a white/clear latex. the lubricant is the standard nonflavored durex lubricant, and they are not the thickest condom Durex makes but it is more than thick enough to withstand rigorous use.

2719,B0018SY8S8,I read one or two reviews saying that the condoms were small and broke and I didn't think I would have a problem with that as my boyfriend is averaged sized. We were all excited and boom! I don't recommend this product for anybody who doesn't want to have a pregnancy scare. But they are really cutely packaged and would've been perfect for someone who is a LOT smaller.,2.0
2720,B0018SY8S8,"They ""did their job"".  I did put them in a little candy dish in the bedroom, just to be fancy.  My hubby and I would then make a bet on which color we would blindly pick out of the dish.  If one of us won, the other person was in charge of the forplay.  TMI?  Maybe. But it really is just a condom.  It fit.  It worked.  Noting more.  Nothing less.",4.0
2721,B0018SY8S8,I was very excited to get these because of all the awesome colors. They arrived very quickly and have a good variety of colors.

I love these condoms, they're so colorful! They work great, look great, and the price is great.To the person who complained about them breaking all the time, I find that hard to believe... My feet are Women 9 (US), and it was very easy to get one of these over a foot. I flexed, spread out my toes, and it was fine. If one of these condoms can fit over my foot and not break, it's very likely to fit over your business and hold up the same, if not better. Unless maybe you're messing with some toy/harness/ring that snagged it. Regardless, these are the only condoms I want to buy now.",5.0
2725,B0018SY8S8,"I received a broad assortment of colors - I think I only had 2 duplicates. The expiration dates were all quite far off, and all the packaging was intact. I've used them all by now and not a single one broke. My partner commented that they don't have as much lube on the inside as some other condoms, so they were a little harder to remove. Since they weren't quite what he wanted, I doubt I'll be buying these again. However, they are still fun and better than other brands we've tried in terms of color selection, fit, and reliability - overall, a solid product.",4.0

2727,B00O70Y3I4,"They work! Like any other glow in the dark thing, you have to put it by the light to ""power it up."" Would be so much better if they didn't come in opaque foil wrappers because if one side was clear plastic like a lot of condom wrappers are, then you could leave it by a light and power it up w/o opening it. The way it is now, you have to open, take condom out, and then hold it by the light for 30-60 seconds like an idiot, before putting it on.They glow awesome though, once powered up.

Find a numbing spray, or ""double bag"" (use two condoms at once) to desensitize.These condoms are best used for kink.  They have wonderful nubs and rings for her, and just enough desensitizing for him to make him feel a little numb, but not incapacitated.  Works great on subs who you want to play with while letting them know they're not supposed to be enjoying it too much..  again, if you want full on numbing or orgasm delay- buy one of the many desensitizing sprays- there are many.",4.0

They are hard to find in stores, so I was pleased to find them on Amazon at such a great price. While these are advertised to slow down a man's orgasm, they feel better than any of the thin condoms I've tried. The texture feels great for both partners, and these don't have a nasty latex smell like so many other brands. My only complaint about these is a small dab of spermicide that looks like a drop of Vaseline. This is easily removed, and should be, since it gets greasy and messy otherwise.

Also if you have a small girth but normal length these will work for you too. My girth is normal so they were a little tight at first but this doubled as a cock ring so I don't mind at all.

My husband has a wider girth that makes any condom width under 2"" uncomfortable. The Skyn Large is 2.1"" wide which he finds to be a much better fit. The length fits him well also(he is 8.5)2. We tried these yesterday and they really ARE very thin! I could feel his particular shape and contours which is a plus because most condoms we've used make his penis feel like a shapeless dildo.3. There is GREAT heat transfer, as described by many other reviewers. Afterwards, my husband asked me to make sure it was still 'on'(it was) so even more points for feeling real for him.CON1. His only real complaint was that he could not feel the 'wetness' that he's used to, but I think we will try the 2 drops of water-based lube on the inside of the condom next time to increase sensation for him.***Update*** The waterbased lube trick was a success!A++ for these condoms.

Mine came in a zip lock bag so don't expect one of those cool boxes you usually get at the store, but who cares as long as the product is intact that is what maters.

2883,B00NZXLDIM,"One caveat right out of the gate, One, in general, has a bit of a snug fit compared to other companies. They do this because to help make them more effective and no point is a regular too tight. Other than that these are great, my fiancé loves them and I like them since they are also a tad thinner so it feels more natural. All One styles are thinner and feel better than brands like Trojan. I always buy them on here as they are far cheaper on Amazon than in stores around me. And a second note all the condoms in this bulk pack when I got it were at least a year and a half until their expiration, so you have more than ample time to get your use of them.",5.0

2907,B0082UG91Y,Magnums speak for themselves and the price is a bonus but my favorite part of this product is that it is offered new and used. I don't know about many of you but I only want new ones.,5.0
2908,B0082UG91Y,I love how cheap and how many condoms they give you because to many of us to stores like target or Walmart and try and buy and value box of twenty and get charged almost thirty bucks where here you get twenty five for 12 bucks you can't beat those prices with a bat so it's safe to say I found my new Walmart,5.0
2909,B0082UG91Y,"Trojan Magnum condoms are probably the perfect fit for any guy out there who is slightly larger than average. They are not constricting at all but also aren't too loose. I have never experienced a pressure mark from the condom's base like standard sized condoms will do to me. I have also never had one slip off, even during the most physically demanding nights with my girl. Would definitely recommend to the big guys out there.",5.0
2910,B0082UG91Y,"Took forever to find a condom that fits... This works. These are on the thicker side of things but hey when things get sketchy that's a good thing right? Tapered at the base slightly, keeps a secure fit without feeling too tight. Haven't had one break yet so good to go.",5.0
2911,B0082UG91Y,I suspect these are not legitimate as I have had more than a single break.  This is uncommon!  The packaging look slightly off from those I would purchase from the store.  Beware of low cost condoms!,1.0
2912,B0082UG91Y,"Something about these was really weird. I know it says Trojan, but I came to the impression that these are somehow different than magnums bought in the store. Off brand maybe? Not too bad, but not that great either. Will not buy again.",3.0

It was interesting to feel the texture but it didn't do much to enhance pleasure on either side.  It didn't take away any, but I have other condoms which feel much better.  These felt a little too think, I prefer thinner condoms.

2919,B0009AJK34,"Hi, this was my first purchase at CMAN. I recieved exactly 100 condoms. It contained around 50 Durex, and rest in Kimono,Beyond Seven, Crown and some others. Its a real bargain and I recieved within 5 days.Good job.",5.0
2920,B0009AJK34,"Nice variety. All were undamaged and have no less than a 2 year expiration date from when i received them. There are some xl in the mix also. Not only a brand variety but style variety also. There were more brands than mentioned in the listing (One, Rough Rider, Seven and a few more I cant remember).  Even included a few single use lubes, a glow in the dark condom, some colored condoms, lubed, non-lubed, studded, ribbed, sensation enhancer, and even a couple extended performance condoms. Great overall variety and even a better price.  Fast shipping too.",5.0
2921,B0009AJK34,"The good:-Great value. About 20 cents per condom, so about as good as you'd get buying about 100 of a single type.-Nice variety overall. For the most part you get six of each type, so definitely enough to give them a few tries before you decide that you hate or love them.The meh:-Got twelve of the durex performax intense, which my s.o. just happens to already dislike.The ugly:-Only received 94 condoms, not 100.-No Trojans. Only one set of Okamoto.-Eighteen of them expire in less than a year (advertised 2-5 years from order date)-Six of those expire in two months....Verdict:I'll still get use out of most of these, but what I received did not meet my expectations.  Personally, I might buy here again, but not before trying another vendor.",3.0
2922,B0009AJK34,"First time purchasing from CondomMan. I must say I'm very impressed! Unrivaled prices, huge assortment of condom types and brands. Shipped to Canada via UPS and then Canada Post, took approximately 2 weeks as expected. Even with the conversion from US to CAN $, ~$0.30/condom is amazing bang for your buck. Number count is exact, expiry dates range form 2016 to 2019. Shipment is discrete in a small bubblewrap envelope, items marked as latex gloves.The only negative so far would be that there were very few of the ""exotic"" condoms that's rare to find in stores, such as the Kimono's and Crown's. Also, no Trojan's in this shipment. But the number and brands of condoms likely vary greatly per order, so it's no biggie.Overall, very pleased with my purchase. Great variety for those who want to try all sorts of condoms, and great value too! I will definitely buy from CondomMan again!Here is a breakdown of what I received:-Durex Pleasure (6)-Durex Sensitive (4)-Durex Sensations (9)-Durex High Sensation (6)-Durex Extra Sensitive (2)-Durex Pleasure Max (6)-Durex Love (6)-Durex Apple (3)-Durex Strawberry (3)-Durex Banana (3)-Lifestyle Colors (6)-Lifestyle Ultra lube (4)-Lifestyle Ultra thin (4)-Lifestyle Ultra Sensitive (6)-Lifestyle Tuxedo (4)-Kimono Thin (8)-Kimono Microthin (3)-Kimono Aqualube (2)-One (8)-Crown (5)-Beyond Seven Studded (2)-Beyond Seven Aloe (2)",5.0

2924,B0009AJK34,I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. Some of the condoms that came in this package seemed small and would break easily. Pretty soon we figured out which ones were the small ones and stopped using those. I think this is a great deal for the price and if you wanted to get them for a fraternity or a sorority it is a good idea. This could be bought for anyone that is trying to practice safe sex. Just beware that if your boyfriend is well hung not all of the condoms in the surprise variety pack are going to fit. I would recommend for other people to buy.,3.0

This was very annoying, as no one wants to have to interrupt themselves to put on a new one.  I don't have a tiny dick, so don't think that's it.  My penis is average size (around 6""), but I just needed something to hold on more snuggly.  I don't care to be some 9""-12"" monster.  I am average, and I think these do the job great.The prelube is whatever.  I don't really mind it, but I would have your own lube ready if you want it.

Somewhat stiff and just a little flexible. I would have preferred the end bead to be smaller. It’s much larger than what the photo shows. In fact, what I got probably isn’t the one shown in the photo. The tube connecting the beads are much thicker.

3015,B001L8ZEOW,"I write a lot of reviews on condoms because I use them alot.  These feel different, its weird but its not a bad weird.  When you first take one out of the wrapper you immediately notice its not your normal condom, it does not roll on like one normally does and it doesnt smell like one.  When I say it doesnt roll on normal I mean I couldnt just grab the tip and roll back, I had to roll it back with both hands, I also dont think it has a bad smell, Lambskin condoms smell bad, I just think if youll been dealing with latex for awhile, this condom will take you by surprise.I really enjoyed the feeling of this condom, it felt thinner then most(Trojen Ultrathin has been the best for me so far) and didnt get all wrinkled up and cut off my bloodflow like latex.  They come in a gold wrapper but there not porn star sized.  LOL  I would recommend this condom to anyone looking for something not latex for a change.",4.0
3016,B001L8ZEOW,"After suspecting that I was allergic to latex, seeing that whenever me and my Fiance' used a regular condom it would burn and irritate me, we decided to try these. They are awesome! I guess I was allergic to latex, because these don't burn or irritate me at all. My Fiance' said that these have a better fit than any of the other condoms we've tried and they are thinner, and don't have a plastic-y feel like most thin condoms; these are really silky and soft. I could tell he was wearing a condom, but it was very slight, this is the least I have ever felt a condom. I've never felt a silkier condom, I usually feel all the wrinkles and creases in a regular condom, but not these, these actually FIT. And they are strong, they didn't break. For some crazy reason my local Publix was selling these for $5 for a box of 12, that's what prompted me to try them.",5.0

We used lubricant with it (bought on the website with grapefruit extract and no paraben), it was a very pleasant experience. (sylk)",5.0
3018,B001L8ZEOW,"Way to tight if you are on the bigger side. It killed much, and almost all feeling. Just way too tight.

If you do buy these, and they fit you nicely, buy lube (that's just a good idea anyway though).",2.0

3020,B001L8ZEOW,"i thought they felt less like plastic sandwich bags than the Trojan Supras.  However, I found the scent to be incredibly off-putting.  I've read elsewhere that these are as close to being latex without actually being latex as possible.  Since I'm allergic to latex, it may be that the similarity to natural latex is why I found them to smell bad.",3.0

3024,B0001Q6CTQ,These have been my favorite since they started making them for us larger men. If your under 8 inches and have average girth then these are not for you. Next size down from the XL's are the regular magnums.,5.0
3025,B0001Q6CTQ,"Magnum XL condoms carry the reliability of the Trojan brand name in an extra large size, in fact, 30% wider than regular condoms.If regular condoms are just a little too constricting, I suggest getting the regular Magnums first. Trojan Magnum XL condoms specifically fit those with an erection circumference of 5.5"" or more (meaning about 10-15% of the market). If needed, they roll out to a full length of about 8"".The first time I tried a Magnum XL, sex felt amazing. The base is tight for a secure fit but thanks to the tapered design, I still have all the blood flow I need to keep things going. The extra assurance from knowing that these condoms are individually electronically tested is an added benefit. The Magnum XL has been my condom of choice for years now.",5.0
3026,B0001Q6CTQ,These condoms are the best because of the size more than anything. Most brands do not cater to the very well endowed man and this definitely takes care of that issue but... I found that they could be a bit unreliable. Over the time that I had them (I'm in a long term monogamous relationship)  they seemed to break 1 out 3 times. That's a lot! Not to mention the smell of the latex is none too appealing. I do like them though and overall I would recommend this product.,4.0
3027,B0001Q6CTQ,"I have never had problems with Magnum condoms.  The regular Magnum condoms are too tight.  I love how the Magnum XL condoms fit.  They are quality condoms and do not slip off.  The quantity is great for the price as well.  If needed and to prevent tears, water based lubricants should be used with condoms.",5.0
3028,B0001Q6CTQ,I have been using Trojan Magnum products for years but have always had problems with how tight they fit.

3030,B0001Q6CTQ,"The old man and I have not been together for a while and it is generally hard to find these sized condoms in stores when we need them, so I got him this ""100-pack"" for Christmas. No matter what it would be a funny gift...but it got even better.So I received the box and thought to myself man...this is a really large box to put 100 pack in. So I opened it...inside were 8 regular 12-pack boxes (that you can buy in store, all of them still had the plastic wrap on them) and 1 baggy with 4 condoms in it! I nearly died! I wrapped them all in different sized boxes and gave him to that way.I took off a star due to ""losing"" that baggy with 4 condoms on it. It's not factory sealed in anyway and so we didn't trust them. Though those were in the foil packaging I could not tell if they had been tampered with.PSA: Guys this works out to like $.63 a condom. When you buy these in a chain store it is double that (usually $1.25 per condom in a 12-pack). I would gladly throw out 4 condoms to get that cheap a price for safety!Don't be a fool wrap your tool!",4.0
3031,B0079K7J0S,"Arrived quickly, and had a giant expiration date sticker on the side. That was my biggest concern; would these be expired when I got them? Thankfully, it's clear that's a concern being well-managed. They don't expire for more than a year from the date I got them.One of the main reasons I chose these was the plastic storage tube and small travel tin. Unfortunately, the lid slips off the tube too easily and the tin doesn't close as tightly as I would like either. Still, vastly superior to a cardboard box and no travel tin at all.The wrappers are super cute with artwork and sometimes quirky text on one side, and descriptions/info on the reverse. So attractive I just want to leave them out and show them to people... but maybe not.There's also a nice mix/variety, as promised (sometimes assortments end up being poorly balanced, but not this one). Also includes three matching round-wrapper lube packs which can fit in the travel tin, which is nice.",5.0

3033,B0079K7J0S,"One Condoms are an amazing brand. They have a large variety and they feel very good for both partners. The packaging is very practical and fun. I love the graphics on the packaging. I like how the packaging is round and has cute pictures. I also like how the condom packaging is in a circle instead of a square packing. To be different for a change. I think it's really awesome that the package gives you a portable condom tin case to take with you when you're traveling. That makes sex encounters very convenient for both men and women.As a woman, these condoms feel amazing. They are very strong and hold up very well. One Condoms makes sex more fun with the packaging. I like how the packaging is unique and fun. I also like that they support charities and artists for their company.

Gave 2 to my friend who also had one break on him. Threw out the rest of the pack.These condoms are way too tight. I no super-man by any means, but i was struggling to put these on every time. Once you get it on and put it to use, the ""aqua lube"" disappeares within 5 minutes and it starts feeling like sandpaper. My guess is thats why they break in the first place,stretched out extra thin latex and no lubrication.Just in comparison, i've just finished a 24 pack of durex extra sensitive. I did not have a single condom break or slip off. So save yourself the stress associated with getting the morning after pill like i had to and buy Durex or Trojan brands.",2.0

3048,B00014UKJG,"I have been using these for years because they provide the most sensitivity of any condom available.  Ask the experts and they will tell you that natural skin condoms feel more like the real thing, and since they are baggy, they are much more comfortable. A little string at the opening holds them in place.  My wife told me she enjoys sex more with Naturalamb and can feel greater sensitivity too. These condoms are the finest money can buy.  Amazon's pricing is incredibly low!  Also, since they are made by the makers of Trojan, I trust their reliablity.

These are sufficiently lubricated with a lubricant which is somewhat oily and does not easily wipe off, and does not agitate me below. I like that these are good for different lengths as well, not all guys are small in all aspects.The only complaint I have is I received these much later than the actual tracking suggests, but as that has nothing to do with the product itself and more Amazon, I give these five stars.",5.0

I am 5.5 inch around at base and does not fit girthier guys. If Kimono made this .25 inches larger in girth it would be the best condom by far.

3260,B00ETBMZU4,This item is fascinating. When opening the amazon box I found myself staring into an afternoon of excitement and my new blender. I couldn't have been more enthralled in my life. The blender works like a dream. It has eight different settings to fit the need of any individual's needs. Now....being a fadorable 38 year old ladies man (call me patamon) I saw this as an opportunity to try these colors out if you know what I mean. When putting the 60 tropical flavored balloons in the blender I thought to myself.....somethings not right......so I added a Cantaloupe and I must say that the Cantaloupe brought out the rich intense flavors of these Japanese delicacies I don't like the greens.....They were green beans. Now what I don't understand is the fact that my blender broke after making this. All of my friends on 9GAG said that they've done it before without a problem...but I digress.,4.0

3321,B0001Q6CBY,"It's nearly impossible to prepare for the sheer absurdity of 100 condoms laid out upon a desk. However one thing tops it: the look on your girlfriend's face when she sees the same sight. (What transpires after, however, is ""business"" as usual.)Purchasing condoms in bulk was a decision I made to spare myself any surprises. Saving a few bucks along the way was obviously a great perk as well. These condoms work exactly as all condoms work, nothing unusual there. While I don't find these to be the easiest condoms to put on (your mileage may vary), and the reservoir to be on the small side, I find the fit to be reassuringly snug. They don't feel cheap and limp like a lot of other smaller brands, but neither are they thick and uncomfortable like some of the ""extra protection"" styles out there. The lubrication on them is also a bit on the light side, which means that you or your partner might want to do something to up the ante there.  That said, the latex / lubrication smell is very minimal with these.Word of caution: When I received a non-descript bubble-pack envelope in the mail, I was initially a bit alarmed. After all, when it comes to condoms, one can never be too careful. Thankfully, after inspecting the packaging and its contents, I felt reassured that my order was delivered safely and without any damage. But should your mailman be keen on jamming packages into your mailbox, even if they don't really fit, then this might be worth noting.",5.0

3325,B006X1IFIO,"Before I found SR Pleasure Dots I had a love hate relationship with textured condoms but I absolutely LOVE these. Sometimes textured condoms can cause a little too much friction and be uncomfortable but that is certainly NOT the case with these condoms. They are textured enough to add that extra-exciting-umpf but not so much as to cause friction burn or even mild irritation. They have the perfect amount of lube on them, not so much to be messy but just enough ease the way. I prefer these over their classic ribbed just because they are not as intense but that is personal preference. This is the perfect way to ease yourself into the wild world of textured condoms. To add to the package, buying them is philanthropic. Best textured condom out there.",5.0

3379,B0029XFWZ4,"Okamoto Beyond Seven condoms are aloe-enriched and made something called Sheerlon - much thinner than regular latex condoms. Although Okamoto says that four times as much lubricant is used, the natural aloe lube alone is not usually enough.

3386,B00015QC88,Product didn't taste bad and actually tasted like mint as advertised.  The lubrication only lasts so long but happy with the product in general and was exactly as advertised.  My husband's only complaint was that the condom was tighter-fitting than he's used to and therefore it was more difficult to tell the different sensations one enjoys from oral sex BUT this was the first time we've tried this brand of condom and usually tight is a good thing as you don't want them to slip off.  Not sure if these come in different sizes or not but if you just need a condom for a condom then we would give them 5 stars.  I would also give them 5 stars for flavor as they were not too minty but just minty enough.  Only gave them 4 stars because they were a little tighter than what we were used to but that is a person by person thing and not the fault of the condom itself.,4.0

3435,B001ECQ72S,"Pros;Cheaper than buying at the storeA little wider than regular magnums.Cons;Lubricant doesn't lubricate muchLubricant irritates (my) skinIt doesn't stretch too wellIt is not long enough to cover entire shaft (condom is about 8.25 inches long)Not much larger than regular Magnum; They are almost the same length (Magnum is about 8 inches long)Veredict;A waste of cash even if at a good price since it won't provide the comfort nor the ""natural"" feel we seek. However it is better than no protection.Since we are all different, I recommend you try different brands.The following are some of my Magnum comparisons to other brands;Kimono Microthin Large (as long as Magnum but they stretch better and therefore feel more comfortable). If Magnums are good for you, you will like these better.Durex XXL was good - Considerably longer than both Magnums at around 9.5 inches and wider than regular Magnum but a little tighter than XL Magnum. Worth trying as a better alternative to Magnum as it protects more area.Lifestyle also make XL but they are smaller than Magnums; Still they might be right if regular condoms are too small but Magnum is slightly big for you.I have not settled the issue of which is better as I have not found a condom that fits me just right so I may update this in the future.I will also appreciate feedback from you guys around my size if you have found a product of better quality and dimensions than the ones I have listed above.I hope you find my review helpful",2.0
3436,B001ECQ72S,"OK...I know this is going to sound like bragging but it's not. It's actually frustrating. The condoms claim to be ""XL"" but they don't seem to be XL. Maybe I don't understand how big XL is. All I know is, they are too small. Maybe I'm some kind of mutant who isn't normal in size and shape but I don't understand the point of tapering down a condom from the head to the base. The head of the condoms will accomidate the 16.5 cm but the base will not. It cuts off the circulation like a rubber band. And not in a helpful, c0ck ring way, but in a harmful, feels like it's cutting in two, way. Very uncomfortable. Also too short but, again, maybe I'm not normal. :)",3.0
3437,B001ECQ72S,my husband and I love these condoms; they fit great and come in 'fancy' gold wrapping.  Trojan is the only brand I know that makes XL condoms so i don't think they have much competition! great product.,5.0

3439,B001ECQ72S,"These condoms are not bad, definitely workable, and the best we've found so far.

3442,B001ECQ72S,"If you're 6.5"" around (and that doesn't make you more of a man!) I recommend stretching it by putting it on a dil_o before using. I don't know why they don't make the end wider to accommodate a larger-than-average glans. But stretching them out is a big help. Just be careful not to break them.",3.0
3443,B0082STZIU,"These are thicker than one would normally expect from an ""ultra sensitive"" condom, but the material itself is rather softer and more flexible than that used in many other condoms.  So while they're not as nice as some of the newer, seriously thin ones (unlike every other Trojan model, their BareSkins are amazing!) I do find them pretty comfortable from my side of the fence, as it were.  Women vary in their reactions, presumably since the thickness from the ""outside"" feels differently to them (and obviously, I can't personally speak to that.)  Some seem to feel (and dislike) the thickness more than others, even with the softer/more flexible material.On the plus side, I think this is the *only* brand/model that has never, ever broken under any circumstances in my (at this point in my life, rather long) experience.  Condom breakage is rare, and personally, I can't imagine ever not noticing it immediately (my immediate reaction is always a fraction-of-a-second moment of panic that something really horrible like a burst blood vessel has happened ""down there""! (lol)), but it is something to consider.  In that respect, these are a great compromise between sensitivity and sturdiness.  (""Heavy duty"" condoms are, in my experience, really, really awful in every way imaginable except perhaps their sturdiness.)",4.0
3444,B0082STZIU,"I'm a bit of an internet shopping addict. All of the gadget deals and used oddities captivate my attention (and money) like few other things can. While that might sound like I don't like to go out into the real world, the truth couldn't be farther from that assumption. I often find myself the center of ladies' attention, and prefer to be safe about it. (As should you, obviously.)So what's this we have here, then? Condoms that can be bought bulk? Online? Perfect. I ordered a hundred of these guys and have been making progress through them. The last hundred I ordered (also from Amazon) performed admirably, so I thought I might as well just go with what I know.The bad? I'm not sure that the lubricant on these is as high quality as other brands. Where it inevitably dries on sheets, skin, etc. it seems to leave behind a sort of latex powder residue which can be highly unnerving if you aren't prepared for it. Because let's be honest- if you're wearing a condom, the last thing you want is some sort of unpredictable thing to happen. These also don't have the most comfortable fit in the world. As in: take this off and you will probably notice that you weren't quite as big as you could possibly have been. The packaging is also exceptionally boring, and that's why I didn't give this five stars.The good? They don't fall off. They work. Not cheaply made. Never broken one during all 120ish that I've used so far. They are dirt cheap in terms of price, so if you and your partner decide to take a short water break, you can get a fresh one and everything is awesome.

My wife could not taste the ""flavor"" at all and heck, I even tasted a separate one and same result, no flavor. They sure smelled good, but unfortunately, the only sensation we were getting was the one in our noses. I will add though, that other reviewers HAVE indicated taste but complained of a lack of concentration of the flavor. (too weak to notice, etc.) So in the meantime, I will look elsewhere.Oh and p.s., I did not think it safe to even use these with her on account of their unknown manufacturer.

3493,B0179TIWE0,"So, I've used several types of condoms, yet I've never used anything of this caliber. The condom goes on a bit tight, but the way it feels is amazing.The regular ultra thin is awesome. It appears to be very strong and hold up very well through rigorous work. Even from pulling out exposing it to the air, it showed no signs of weakening or tearing. The ultra thin is a guinness book of world records setter (as all the condoms are.) I thought that was just a gimmick as I've tried several ""ultra thin"" products. No my friends, this is in another league of it's own. The smell is actually quite nice. It is somewhat floral, yet I can't seem to figure out exactly what it is. I've has terrible smells from very high name brand condoms which actually make the experience not as good. When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it's not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don't expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.The extra smooth is very similar to the regular. Everything still rings true on this condom. It allows for a bit less friction. If I read on the packaging it is almost like a lotion for your insides. I'm not sure if I can vouch for that yet. I do know it is a bit more slick and that's all I've noticed so far.Overall, I had a very pleasant experience with these condoms. I think they are well made and feel great. They are a bit on the pricey side, yet I understand why they have such a premium. With this product you get 24 condoms in a very nice box. It's very high quality.I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.",5.0
3494,B0179TIWE0,"I would be very hesitant to purchase these again in the future, and would be highly unlikely to recommend them to anyone who wants the preventative benefits of wearing this hoodie.The first box, the ultrathin, was good.  Quite good, in fact.  My wife and I found them to be far more enjoyable to use than other hoodies we had used in the past.  I was a little disappointed in the near lack of a seed storage area at the tip, it did require some getting used to.The second box, the ultrasmooth, was just plain bad.  We had one break during installation, and two additional failures during usage.  This box also seemed smaller, girth-wise, and made installation more of a chore.  They were not expired, so I don't know what the excuse for failure was.  We decided not to risk it and tossed the last few remaining from this box.The only reason that these get 2 stars is because of the one good box, it was really good.The one bad box, well, it was really bad.  You shouldn't have this high a failure rate with this type of product, especially considering the price.

3495,B0179TIWE0,"So, after some hesitation, I decided to pull the trigger and order a box of condoms online. I got them at a discount in exchange for my honest, review, so I decided why not? Cheap condoms! (when has that every been a problem...?)These condoms purport to be the world's thinnest and have studies and awards to prove it, which is pretty neat. I can definitely say that they are some of if not THE thinnest condoms I've ever used. They are also extremely well-lubed. These are all good things that we want in a condom. So why four stars instead of five? Even the box they come in is minimalistic but cleverly made and vibrant.The four stars come from two small issues: because the condoms are super thin, they are also super tight. In the heat of the moment, I have experienced some (minor) difficulty getting the condom on. Look, I'm fortunate enough to be pretty average to slightly above in terms of size, and I imagine that anyone that is actually seriously well-endowed (especially girth-wise) will have issues putting these condoms on. They were made in China. My other issue is that there is a lot of lube packed into each one of these guys on the outside. Putting one on involves getting your hands pretty slick/lube-y. Again, these are not serious issues but minor complaints, but they are enough to keep me from rating it a perfect 5-star product.",4.0
3496,B0179TIWE0,"Very nice. A lot thinner than your average drug store condom. They almost feel like your guy has nothing on at all.

The variety is good for those who are first-time users of condoms (so it gives a chance to see what they like), and they are high quality (we didn't have any problems with breakage or anything). The box comes with four different condoms (Twisted Pleasure, Intense, Her Pleasure, and Fire and Ice). I will review each condom type:The Fire and Ice are good for women who are virgins. This is because the Icy-Hot-type of lubrication thereon helps her muscles and skin to be a little more numb than usual down there, which allows for the necessary stretching, without nearly as much pain for her. After a few uses, the transition to other condoms (or not using condoms) is a lot easier for her.Her Pleasure is really great for helping her to experience an orgasm a lot better. It takes women a lot longer to get ""spooled up"" (if you will) for an orgasmic experience than a man. As long as time it taken for her to get near to that before insertion, these condoms will definitely help her get there.The Twisted Pleasure are very nice for putting a new spin on the intimate experience. My wife and I definitely enjoyed this one.The Intense condoms were our favorite, once my wife had had enough sexual experience. The really deep ridges were enough to provide a plethora of pleasure for both of us. We highly recommend this Pleasure Pack.With the purchase of this, we would also recommend purchase of a bottle of lubrication..We have yet to find a condom that comes with enough lubrication in and of itself.",4.0

I have always loved Kimono condoms: super thin and lots of feeling for me, but I rarely see them in stores and/or in the right size. In fact, normally I can't find a size on the condom box!? What's up with that? These fit perfectly, and we discovered three more brands we would have never found, that we love now too. Shipping was fast. Envelope was professional and discreet. We were so impressed with the customer service, we now have a monthly subscription from the company online ([...]). We get all the brands we love for less than store prices, including shipping, sent directly to us. No more worrying, no fuss, and no running out in the middle of the night trying to find something half way suitable when we're in the mood. Thank you Lucky Bloke!",5.0

3546,B00WRZF5JC,"Like the other reviews said, the condoms are a bit on the small size. However, we still had a lot of fun with these. My boyfriend said that even though they were a bit tight, they still felt very good. The ultrathin are basically regular condoms besides the fact that they're so thin. The over-time condoms we were rather excited to try, but honestly they weren't that great. They come in sets with silicon rings(basically cock rings crossed with zip ties). Like cock rings, the purpose is to constrict blood flow and thus allow men to maintain their erection for a longer period of time. But these are not that comfy to wear compared to a good quality cock ring. While the over-time might be nice every now and then to just start off with, I'd say just get a nice cock ring and save some money in the long run.

The first 5 or so inches from the tip are bulbed to allow the condom to slack up and provide extra pleasure to both the wearer and the partner, and it is sufficiently thin as well.

That said, I cannot recommend this condom unless you are 7-8 inches in length.Apparently Trojan Stimulations Ecstasy (as opposed to Trojan Pleasures Ecstasy, which is this product) has ribbing along the bulbed section.

3645,B006X1IF6G,"My partner and I have tried most condoms, as they are our primary form of birth control.  We were using Trojan classic ribbed non-spermicide prior to using Sir Richard's, but we have also used Lifestyles and Durex.  The first thing my husband noticed was that these were thinner than Trojans, but still felt durable.  They did not have any odor (something about condoms that ALWAYS annoyed me!), and they did not leave any weird aftertastes or smells if you fool around later...after 3 months of regular use, we're going to stick with these.I'm going to share the pros and cons from a woman's perspective (for those interested):Pros:- These condoms have, in my opinion, the best texture and feel of any male condom.  They are ribbed, which adds a little extra texture and friction that I personally enjoy (the ultra thin were like silk - no friction at all. They are as close to au natural as he has felt to me while wearing a condom. The pleasure dots were incredible, but a little too much for me to experience all the time!).  I could see where this would depend on the person, however.- There is no aftertaste, no odor, and no physical sensation or residual lube left by the condom after use.  As someone who found her skin more sensitive after having our first child, I have to say this was the best!  The way I felt after we used this condom is actually no different than when we used no condom at all.  Anyone with chemical sensitivities or allergies can understand how important that is!Friends who have had several issues with their vaginal health have also told me these condoms help keep them more balanced.-  My husband has never complained about these.Read more ›",5.0
3646,B006X1IF6G,"After ten years on the pill my wife stopped using hormonal birth control last month due to its negative effects on her emotions. Due to some allergy issues we had to find a condom that did not contain all of the usual ingredients you find in a typical Trojan, etc. We tried a sample box of Sir Richard's from our local Whole Foods (Thin, Ribbed, and Pleasure Dots) and she much preferred the Ribbed. I can't feel much difference between the three, but since she loves the feel of the Ribbed so much we go with those. A little extra lube (Astroglide Paraben free for us) is helpful for the outside, but also on the inside (after ten years 'au natural' I found finishing in the condom to be difficult and sometimes impossible - adding a little lube to the inside of the condom helps with that problem greatly and allows me to finish in a reasonable amount of time without frustration). They aren't cheap at $10 for 12, but they are good quality and consistent. We've had no breakage problems after two boxes and they open and go on easily.",5.0

Every other latex condom on the market that we've tried has felt plasticky and not good, not real, so I always thought I had to live with that and just accept the sensation-deadening effect as an unfortunate consequence of using condoms.  These Okamotos have proven that it isn't so!  Since we discovered Okamotos years ago, they are the only brand we trust, and this particular 004 kind is by far the thinnest we have encountered.Despite the thinness, the condom is very durable.

I noticed two things right away; first, the regular size was extremely tight and second they were much thinner than the large Trojans.  I like to compare the difference between the two as having been using a Mack truck tire and then switching to Saran wrap--it really is that different.However, because the regular size Kimono was too tight I didn't put it on properly and had my first broke condom, ever.  Having used the large thick Trojans for so long i didn't even know it was possible to break a condom.  Well it is and I learned my lesson.  I find that the large Kimono is still too tight (but not like a tourniquet, like the regular size) but I don't think it is so tight that it will impair my ability to put it on.Oh yeah, this seller sends them in a plastic baggie which I find a little strange.",4.0

I suppose there are multiple ways to interpret that note, and while I was certainly aware that these condoms were probably going to be smaller than the average condoms sold in the western hemisphere, I figured they would have some degree of elasticity to accommodate whoever needs the extra room. Lets face it, these are very expensive condoms, I'm surprised they don't do anything special like glow in the dark, sing for you, etc. That said, 4 of the condoms in the box went to waste as they were simply way too small to wear and did not go where they should have within 5 minutes of me relentlessly trying. The two pieces that I was magically able to put on were tight to the point of being very uncomfortable, and perhaps due to the latex-free material used, these are definitely not as elastic.PROS:------Extremely thin - as advertisedGreat/interesting packaging, very different than the usual wrapCONS:-----Microscopic in sizeNot as elastic as the latex alternativesUncomfortable to wearCould probably use some more lubrication",2.0

3860,B003BGXNB8,"My girlfriend and I tried this brand and really liked them so I bought a dozen. We have used Trojan (her pleasure) mostly in the past which were okay and didn't break on us but these condoms stand out. The certainly feel more pleasurable for me and she climaxes much easier during sex with these than the Trojan brand (I'm assuming this is because of the little ribbed pouch.) We used all 12 and didn't have any problems with them breaking. I believe these would fit anyone from 4.5""-6"" as I am 6"" and average girth and I feel like they would be too tight if I were any bigger.Overall a great buy! Plus you can buy 12 on Amazon for approx. $5 with shipping and a 3 pack in the store is approx. $3",5.0

I won't go back to the other brands again.Just FYI they don't come in a box, they were in a bag.  Not a big deal.",5.0
3862,B003BGXNB8,"This is such an improvement over regular condoms and even ""female condoms"" that I'll never use anything else. The degree of sensation by having subtle ribs on the inside, under the head (yeah, there's a top and bottom on the sucker) makes having safe sex a real pleasure.",5.0
3863,B003BGXNB8,I finally figured out how to open these. In the dark its hard to see that the top center has a slight rip to tear it open from. I am used to just opening a condom from any side or angle so thats a downside to these guys. If you have a genital piercing then these work well otherwise I don't see the point of the extra head room.,3.0
3864,B003BGXNB8,I've never been thrilled about using condoms. My biggest complaint would be that most condoms decrease sensation and this condom is the only exception to that that I have found so far. They are great! I am married and we only use condoms occasionally and these are the only ones we will use. You have to try it to believe it. They area amazing.,5.0
3865,B003BGXNB8,"I'm not a man so this is second-hand information, but these rock! My partner said they felt really nice compared to normal condoms. All the expiration dates were a long ways off, and not a single one broke. While these aren't our go-to condoms, I'll probably be keeping a few in my nightstand from here on out.Note: If you don't last as long as you'd like to in bed, you might want to try another condom because these will only increase sensation.",5.0
3866,B003BGXNB8,"Great product, the proverbial better widget.  Truly - pleasure, PLUS.  It's as close as a guy can come to getting his foreskin back.When I discovered these (in 1995?) they were Mnfd in China, dist. by Global Protection Corp, Boston MA, but then they went away for awhile. Now, upon rediscovering the current Pleasure Plus, I see they are made in Malaysia, Mnfd by One, Boston MA.  Either I've gotten thicker over the years, or these got narrower & to be honest I'm at an age where things are shrinking.  I find this new version a little tight which kills some of the Plus compared to the original.  I still recommend this product, it's worth a try at the least.  At worst you'll discover a good condom, at best if it fits you right you'll discover pleasure amplified.  I've never had one break.  I do wish they would add a color dot or little bump on the top side to make it easier to get it on right as there is a top & bottom to these.",4.0

At the same time, they feel closer to ""nothing at all"" than any other condom on the market.

I'd suggest anyone new to them look for videos on youtube on how to insert (instructions are on the packet, but there are useful videos that help).  I tend to place a little extra lube, LITTLE is the key term, on the outside of the condom and then insert.  Husband adds lube to the inside of the condom before we start.  Works wonderfully!  Husband has full sensation as do I, not restrictive for him and when we are done he simply holds the outer lip of the condom and slowly pulls it out with him.  Super easy and quick.

It turns out that Amazon CHANGED the listing so that what was a polyisoprene condom for those with latex allergies is now automatically shipping a LATEX condom with a nearly identical box and name. This is VERY dangerous, especially for those who subscribed to these and don't read the box because it looks the same. People can get very ill or die from this oversight on Amazon's part.I wanted to make sure this wasn't my error, so I went and pulled out the condoms I received from the first shipment when I subscribed. As I expected, they are the correct Avanti Bare NON-LATEX/POLYISOPRENE condoms.I searched my gmail account which saves all emails and found every email regarding my avanti bare orders...sure enough, there was never a notification of product change. Sometime between April and June, the product and product page were changed (not the link or subscriptions though).Immediately upon receiving the latex version today, I contacted Amazon to escalate the issue (spoke with Nicholas). I then searched Amazon for ""polyisoprene condoms"" with prime shipping checked and THIS LATEX VERSION is the FIRST product that comes up. Why?

It contained 18 Crown, 12 Crown Assorted Colors, and 18 Beyond Seven condoms, and 2 vibrator rings in a sealed package which each come with 1 Unil@tex condom (Malaysia), so technically you are getting 50 condoms.  The vibrating rings are intended for single use and last about 45-60 minutes.  They are kind of fun, but my GF said they are not intense enough (but she likes very intense clitoral stimulation).The only issue I have with this order is the packaging in which the condoms were shipped.  They arrived in one of those bubble padded envelopes with no durable protection around them.  I noticed a tear and a hole in the envelope which prompted me to inspect each and every condom carefully.  I found two condoms which had holes in the wrappers, presumably from whatever made the holes in the shipping envelope, so my advice is to thoroughly inspect every condom wrapper front and back before you start using them.One other thing you should know about these condoms is they are represented to be Japanese condoms, which I trust, but these are actually made in Thailand.  I don't know what that means when it comes to sensitivity and quality, so I tried a little research.

4217,B00ATBCZCQ,"If you care about the environment, remember that a condom makes an excellent water balloon or birthday party decoration. Why does this matter? Because of the law of environmental replacements. A used condom used in place of an eco-unfriendly balloon is a balloon that never existed... so how green is that? At a wedding, the wedding coordinator can fill all the happy couple's saved used condoms with helium, then release them as the bride exits the church, making for a very meaningful and moving fertility ceremony. If the groom gets a little help from his friends in filling out the used condom bouquet, there may be enough condomiums to lift the flower girl into the air, which is a blessing on the marriage and a sure promise of fecundity. Plus, all the trash that flower girl would have created during her life is probably not going to be a problem now. When she gets to OZ, the recycling program there is so green that they call it the Emerald City.I only gave this product four stars because you can't get that much helium into it without bursting it.

4225,B0029XFWNG,"I (we) stayed from Trojan Ultra-Thins for experimentation and ventured into the latex-free assuming they would be thinner... WRONG (I pity those with latex-allergies! Sucks to be you). Back to latex and we tried some Durex Extra-Sensitives, they fit SO bad. They kept bunching up at the top and creating friction so uncomfortable I kept having to stop. I was about to go back to our trusty Trojans when I decided to try these since the price was so enticing. I LOVE THEM. They fit so well! No bunching. No slipping off at the base. No breaking. Nothing bad at all and super thin to boot!They are all pink which is funny.To those complaining about getting a bag full of condoms in the mail instead of excess packaging (depending on the vendor): Shame on you! They're already individually wrapped! I personally hate unnecessary packaging, not only from a ""green"" standpoint but a convenience one as well.p.s. I'm sorry I used the word ""green"" I personally hate the slogan but it fit.",5.0
4226,B0029XFWNG,"These are really then and very close to having nothing on at all. They are minimally lubed so they don't feel greasy or sticky, and they don't carry that horrible latex smell that many other brands do. Never had an issue of breakage so far. Recommended.",5.0
4227,B0029XFWNG,"I was really hoping that the hype about these was true, and it is. These are very thin and very strong. The thinness actual lets you feel tiny movements while wearing one. I did some crazy stretching tests, and couldn't get one to break. I've had horrible problems with Trojan condoms, but these feel great and I actually trust them. They are fairly tight, but that contributes to the sensation. They are a little more difficult to put on than average, but it's worth the extra effort. They fit well for me (above average length/girth). They are as wide as most condoms, but only seven inches long. These things are an incredible value.",5.0
4228,B0029XFWNG,"I often have an issue with condoms where it becomes difficult for me to finish due to a distinct decrease in sensation , but these condoms are remarkably thin and feel almost as if you aren't wearing one at all. Also, thankfully, as thin as they may be, they still feel durable, which of course is a very important quality for a condom to have.",4.0
4229,B0029XFWNG,"After researching laboriously online I discovered that Okamoto no longer makes these condoms in Japan but in Thailand. Other users have said how this affects how thin and reliable the condoms actually are but I have not had any from the Japan batch so I wouldn't know. My shipment was from thailand. But overall these condoms are very thin and give a VERY close fit. Im average size and girth and they work great for me. If you are larger though I would suggest getting a looser fit since these might be stretched quite a bit and not feel as good. So just be warned that these are made in Thailand and I HAVE heard of some breaking, but so far I have not had any break on me (a little bit over 10 used at this point.)",4.0
4230,B0029XFWNG,"This is an amazing brand, the thinnest condoms I've ever used; literally almost like nothing is there. They're like a pinkish color.

This is not true, after extensive research I've learned that the quality is exactly the same, exact same production methods, although the dimensions for the condom have changed slightly; it's much more tighter now. Was delivered on time, great price, great quality, doesn't get much better than this!",5.0
4231,B0029XFWNG,"I have to admit I was skeptical that these condoms would give the ""as close to wearing nothing at all"" feeling, but they do.

4239,B000FQ4X0C,She loves whenever I use these so when she's happy. Everyone is happy. Good product. I like that they are disposable.  No need to clean them up every time . Just toss them and use a new one next time,5.0
4240,B000FQ4X0C,"A great starter product for couples looking to try new things. My spouse and I have not used a vibration ring before and wanted to try a cheaper, more disposable option before investing in a more expensive option. The ring worked well the entire time we had intercourse, and still vibrates, so in theory you could use the ring again as long as the battery lasts. We did not use the condom the comes with the pack so I do not have any feedback for that particular product. Overall, this is a product that we would purchase again.

4241,B007ZLL2GS,"I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction.  As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way.  I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life.  These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation.  I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there):  If you're ... y'know ... ""oversized,"" you might find these too tight.  My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.",5.0
4242,B007ZLL2GS,I like these condoms as compared to most non-latex. I've tried another kind (forget the brand) that were painful they were so hard and crinkley.

However what your getting is nothing special, just a plain basic condom that's thinner than most competitors.

They feel great, the lube actually lasts as long as it needs to, and overall I think they are my favorite condom for comparing feel/lubrication quality.

Opening the box, they look like they are designed for horse; Ron Jeremy couldn't use these condoms effectively.  That ""room for movement"" actually means that it looks and feels like you're putting a sandwich bag on your penis and fastening it with a rubber band (my fiance reports that's what it feels like to her too).  Texturally, the ribs are reminiscent of the molted skin from the movie Alien.  You get almost no feeling of sliding, just pressure.  I think you'd get more sensation using a latex glove.  In short, only use this condom if your choice is it or no sex, otherwise get anything else!",1.0
4298,B003TTCGWO,"I bought a 10 pack of these and only used three. They're as wide as any extra-wide condom you'll buy, which is NOT advertized anywhere, which is extremely annoying. As others have said, I'm not the cockness monster, but I certainly am not small, and these were too loose. Another one in the box was tighter than the other two I used, and while it fit correctly...I could definitely tell I was wearing a condom. The three times we've used these have been our three most disappointing times we've had intercourse, my first time even being much better.The only other brands I've used were generic style Trojans, which were alright, and Beyond Seven ""Sheerlon"", which were amazing. If you're looking for a reliable condom that feels like nothing is there, go with Beyond Seven. They don't ACTUALLY feel like nothing is there, (no condom will) but after a few minutes of lovemaking with them on it will feel like they're not there. Almost every time I've used them I've stopped at least once to make sure it hadn't fallen off.",1.0
4299,B003TTCGWO,My partner and I gave these a go and came to a solid conclusion:The feeling is something oddly reminiscent of what we imagine a trash bag to feel like. We use Trojan because other brands are too small and simply won't fit-so that is not the issue by any means.As a female reviewer I can honestly tell you it cuts off most sensation and makes for a very frustrating time.

These are very good condoms, and I like the texture as a male, but I found better solace in the other brands. These were pretty thick compared to the rest, smelled heavily of latex, and the lubricant was less than stellar.

Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2"" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir.

Not too thin, not too thick, generally great on both sides of the wall, if not the best.The Ultra Thins scared my Girlfriend to the point where she refused to continue using them. She was worried they were too thin. I thought they were great for that reason.

My lady friend is very small in her lady garden and I've had trouble with condoms slipping and sliding off my old fella when we get together. I'm textbook average in size, possibly 5% under the bar and I like that these are condoms built for the 99% of us who don't need 13"" of freakin rubber just rolled up wasting space at the base. These condoms are very narrow, and about 9"" or so long, so they fit snugly and don't slide about (which actually feels great!) and there's not so much unnecessary extra length.I like em.

This translates to more feel, but they certainly aren't as thin as regular thin condoms.  The fit and added sensation make me a fan of these, but I will continue searching for the perfect larger sized condom that has no compromises in fit, sensation, and overall feeling.  Until then these will work perfectly and she is a fan of them also so that's always a big plus.",4.0

4356,B001G7QQ36,"I don't know why this condom has not caught on in mainstream market, because it should.  I've used Trojan, Durex, and a bunch of other brands before, but this is the thinnest and feels the best.In addition to being thin, this condom seems to be slightly smaller than American ones in terms of girth (circumference).  This in turn made the condom even thinner when worn because it gets stretched more.But this may be too sensitive if the guy is looking to prolong his endurance.  I found the Trojan ribbed to be thick enough for that purpose.The instruction that comes with this condom is hilarious.  I got a kick out of reading it.",5.0
4357,B001G7QQ36,"Condoms are the bane of almost every gentleman's existence.  They keep you healthy and sane but aren't much fun.  Kimono's get the job done and have the most sensation of all of ultrathins I've tried. (Durex, Lifestyles, Trojan)  Bigger gentleman (<~6.5 inches) be warned:  This product is not built for you. Check out the Kimono's large version which fits and protects better.  Also be more careful when handling and using these, if you and your lover are crazy rough in the bedroom you'll want to look out or consider using Durex extra sensitive which is almost as good and sturdier.  Also if you don't put it on right on a frequent basis you'll also want to look elsewhere as they can fail easy if not used correctly.  If you're looking for more sensation and better sex for you and your lover,  I highly recommend these as long as you treat them carefully.",4.0
4358,B001G7QQ36,"So this is my third review of condom brands. While you may have preferences to feel, comfort, security or are just brand-loyal, I encourage you to safely try the Kimono brand of condoms. These latex, Japanese-made condoms are the best on the market, I believe. Despite the other brand of condoms you can get in bulk and for dollars, this is still a value even if you were to shop retail for condoms (at the drugstore).I am a big fan of Kimono condoms; they have never broken on me, are the thinnest in the market, and give me a real sense of security and safety when using them. Though some might buy condoms with the only goal in mind: to save money and get in bulk, they often overlook quality and the track record of the condom. Not only are these condoms highly rated and manufactured to the strictest of guidelines and tests, but knowing the Japanese and their infusion of tradition into their manufacturing, honor in craftsmanship is a real asset for manufacturing condoms. And so not one has broken on me, nor failed to meet expectations-a common area most other condom companies don't bother to look closely into.For the price vs quantity, this is a real deal! The picture of the product looks nothing like the ones shipped to me and with normal reasoning; the picture is simply outdated. Same product advertised, but the manufacturer ships them in this elegant and classy box approx the same size. Amazon shipped it to me, and it came in a box and SEALED! Very nice, and I can't stress how important that is! You never ever want to have the fate of an unexpected pregnancy rest on the carelessness of a seller that ships damaged condoms to your doorstep. Even micro tearing which can result to prolonged exposed to the elements, friction, etc.Read more ›",5.0

As for feel, they are typical condoms and not remarkable in either a positive or negative way. Decent texture (smooth - no ribs or dots or studs. But a nice smooooth texture.

She also noted that the amount of lube is on the light side, which she says she prefers to the heavily lubed condoms.This condom is our favorite so far - and as a major bonus it's one of the cheapest ones out there!!

4377,B007I6Z46E,"Now that I have got nearly all the toys I have ever wanted, I thought I would also explore the very last  type of toy I have not yet tried, and from those available, the Trojan was the only one which made sense for me to try, as the others are way too thin for me at this stage. So now that I have played with it, I can definitely say that it is odd -- but is it any odder than the TSX Octoplug, or indeed the Polyphemus caterpillar? I don't think so ;)BUILD: The takable part of the Trojan maxes out at only a hair above 76 mm (3""). The column flares up to a respectable 118 mm (4.66"") just above the base, which would be much more interesting. Alas, due to the way the pedestal is scuplted, it is not possible to invert the toy and proceed. What is left for use then is the top half of the column, up to around 250-255 mm (10""). Past the crest at the top, said column is very smooth, with not a mark on it apart from the tiny bump, which is unremarkable, but serves as a marker, indicating where to stop. That may be obvious as one proceeds, but it is still good to have, as it is all to easy to go too far, and cause an injury.MATERIALS: That is definitely a possibility with a toy this long, particularly that it is topped with a flattish pancake with a crest. Depending on where you get this toy, it may or may not come with extra hardener. Not every vendor discloses this information (the one on Amazon does, which is good), and not among those, not every vendor offers a choice.

4448,B001GAY1OO,"These are by far the best condoms I have ever used (previous brands/products trojan, lifestyle, durex, magnum, and iron grip. After things get a little warmed up these condoms feel unbelievably natural. It took me a few  times to get comfortable with them because you begin to feel like they are coming off because things feel so natural but these condoms aren't going anywhere until you rip them off. We ALL know that feeling where we are into it but we know the condom is one and then things feel a little TOO good and we pull out and look down to see if the condom came off. Not the case with these. If you put them on correctly and unroll them all the way down, they stay on and suck and stick to your skin. I pulled out on more than one occasion and saw that the condom was still on, tried to pull it off because I thought it leaked or broke and the condom was like a suction cup and was not coming off, period. Didn't do much for the mood but it gave me confidence that these puppies are not coming off in the heat of the a moment. We all know the infamous position that makes most condoms traditionally slide off. This one stayed on no matter how hard, fast, deep or slow the action got. Again, the key is to put it on CORRECTLY. If you do that it's not going anywhere. I'm buying a larger pack and will stick with this brand going forward.",5.0

The instructions and functionality are extremely ambiguous on which of the 3 buttons to press/hold or tap (still trying to make sense of it all), but what is obvious is there are many more patterns than suggested in the manual.

4454,B00NXEVA04,"This is a major departure in male self pleasure. Just about every device out there tries to replicate the sensations of sex or hand stroking. This takes a very different approach, delivering gradual sensory overload to a guy's most sensitive nerve endings. I had my doubts that this would work for me but as it is a different technological approach, a different mind-set is what makes it work. This isn't a device for a quickie. Plan some time to relax, sit back, get that favorite fantasy going in your mind and then go through the settings. The buttons are easy to use and very responsive. Some thick water based lube increases vibration transfer. Just click it on and then click through the vibration patterns until things happen. The first time, it was sneaky. I felt good  but not great and then I hit one setting which pushed all of my buttons at once and about a minute later without any thrusting or stroking of any kind, I exploded.

4518,B00CG3V20G,"I ordered the stud stopper, and chose the large because it listed a poundage that my male dog falls into (26-85lbs.).  When it arrived it smelled so strongly of chemicals that I had to let it air out for a couple of days as I was afraid to put it on my dog.  When I did put it on my dog I was kinda surprised at how simple the item actually is, it is essentially a velcro belt molded to a large piece of leather which acts like a shield between the studs member and any potential female.  This would have worked, except that the stud stopper kept falling back so low on my male dog's hips that it was on the wrong side of his genitals, and therefore wasn't going to stop anything.  I adjusted and tightened the strap a couple of times, but I couldn't get it tight enough fitting without becoming overly constricting to my dog's abdomen to keep it in place.I emailed the seller informing her of the problem, and was disappointing when she responded defensively, and claimed that I never submitted measurements per the email from her company.  I responded back informing her that no such ordering information requests existed on the Stud Stopper Amazon listing, just a general prefab size and weight range. She then spent several emails backpedaling and generally giving the impression that she didn't know what her listing even said, and indicated she would change the listing and that I could send the product back with measurements and she'd try to fix it.  I responded that I would be interested in that, but then never heard from her again when I inquired what measurements specifically she needed to make the adjustments.Read more ›",1.0

The two dogs in question are American Staffordshire Terriers. For those who are familiar with the breed will understand that this is quite a feat. Being a powerful and acrobatic pair I was much amazed and happy at the outcome with this heat cycle. Of course you do not just put it on and leave it until the heat is over.

4569,B003M72CD6,"So, I felt the need to mention to those who are not aware that friction and heat destroy the structural integrity of condoms. Both will wear down the thin rubber and make it far more likely the condom will break, therefore the last place you want to keep a condom is in your pocket or a glove compartment. This item would be appropriate for a purse if you wish to prevent puncture of the condom, but given that pocket use is still advised in the ad it still only merits one star. If you are looking for a safe way to carry condoms in your wallet, even this wallet, I would advise Trojan's hard cased 2Go condoms. Or try looking for another hard case to store the condoms, old memory card holders, gameboy game cases, mint tins, any small container that will prevent compression.

But on the plus side of its thickness is you will go much, much longer until you are......Finished.  My wife and I occasionally use it,  but I use it more for her than for me because of the fact that it takes a little bit away from me,  but adds so much more lasting time for her.  She is ""Happy"" that we can have long lasting multiple positions before I'm ""DONE""  And yes,  I do ""cum"" to a conclusion,  but more extended in time.  So if anything,  get it for her.

4613,B004RRGGDC,"My girlfriend and I have tried many different types and brands of condoms. To us these win hands down. With traditional latex condoms you have the horrible odor, reduced feeling, and lack of warmth transmitted. These both of us had much more feeling as well as no odor. They do feel and look sort of fragile but as we can attest they are quite durable. The only downside with these, at least for me is they are a little tough to put on. They are quite snug and I am an average size. If you have a larger size these are definitely not the ones for you.We will continue to use these! Plus it was such a deal here on Amazon. At the store it would cost a little more money for two boxes than it did here for three.",5.0
4614,B004RRGGDC,"I have used all sorts of non-latex condoms and these are the best.  I used to enjoy Durex Avanti condoms and enjoyed them even though they were like wearing a sandwich bag, but they were discontinued and replaced by Durex Avanti Bare and are unacceptable.  Bare and Skyn both get really tacky really easily and I have shred vaginas with them due to the tackiness gripping the labia and ripping it.  No joke, this happened on multiple occasions.Anyway, the Supras fit well and feel pretty alright, if grading on a curve.  I mean, condoms are like wearing snowpants and non-latex condoms are even worse, but these aren't horrible and are far better than STIs or pregnancies.  They don't get nearly as tacky as the previously mentioned condoms, but I still suggest checking them occasionally to be sure and have lube on hand.",4.0
4615,B004RRGGDC,"I'm 18 and originally purchased these condoms because my girlfriend and I realized that she had a slight latex allergy.

I originally used Crown condoms by Okamoto, but the Trojan Supras completely blow them out of the water!My girlfriend recently went on the pill, but we still use condoms once in a while when we don't have time to get messy. These condoms, by far, provide the most realistic sensation of any condoms I've tried. The body heat transfer through polyurethane is superb, and it really is the next best thing to nothing at all.I'm on the larger side of the penis spectrum, but these condoms still fit perfectly. I've used them countless times and have yet to have a bad experience. These are definitely a must buy for anyone looking to experiment with non-latex condoms or looking for condoms that bring them closer to the real thing.PROS:-Amazing body heat transfer-Works for girls with allergies-Perfect fit that isn't too suffocating around the baseCONS:-On the expensive side.

What I mean is these (any any type of Polyurethane condoms) are so tight, strong and thin, you will swear that your almost not wearing one.  So it will cause you to go out a little faster than with a thick latex condom.Rolled super tight from manufacture, and you WILL NEED lube most of the time when using these.  Check out the extra lubed ones if this is a issue.If the band hurts will need to get the magnum ones they run tightTAKE YOUR TIME PUTTING THEM ON.  The are rolled tight as can be, and because of this the rubber ring can get tangled up when rolling them on.  Either use some lube as you roll them on, or if it gets caught roll it back up a little bit, grab the ring and slowly guide it on.  (if your looking to be smooth, might want to practice before game time, or your will look like a condom rookie)More than likely will need some lube, They are rolled up so tight (because of the material) the lube seems to be squeezed out of them.OVERALL:My favorite condom, we started using them because of allergies, and have never looked back.  I love the heat feeling and she loves the heat and the not there feeling.  The first time we used them, I kept stopping because it felt like it broke.  Best type of condom I've found, and 10 times better than all the ribber, twisted, heating lube stupid stuff out there.",5.0

4620,B0088FLLK2,"I received this product very quickly and I was anxious to see if it would have any effect on me. After taking the recommended dosage for the first 5 days I noticed that I not only had more energy, but I also noticed an increase of my sex drive. This has definitely shown me that it has the potential to change my life in a very positive way. I will continue to use it as long it gives me the results that it has so far. I would recommend this to anyone that has any issues with there sex drive or energy level.Update...It's been a few weeks now and I just purchased another bottle of this Tongkat Ali. I have found that shortly after running out of the first bottle I ordered, the extra energy and increased sex drive had began to wain. I don't know if my case is different then most people, but I dealt with a severe illness for the last 18 years of my life (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). For anyone not familiar with that illness...you basically feel like you have a severe case of the flu every day, which includes full body muscle aches and pain along with brain fog, poor sleep, non existent sex drive, no energy...and just an overall feeling of frustration.When I had first heard on the internet about Tongkat Ali being a natural way to improve not only my energy level, but also my sex drive and I just had to give it a try. It was recommended that you should only get the Indonesian form...and you should get at least 1:100 strength. After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it. I'm so glad that I made the choice that I did. I was so surprised by the results I just have to get another bottle to keep that feeling going.

4968,B017YMNVNY,"These are made from some kind of thermoplastic, they are DEFINITELY NOT SILICONE.  I tested it by touching it with a hot nail, and it melted immediately.  Silicone has a very high melting point, and it has many advantages that make it the perfect material for sex toys. Calling it silicone is blatant FALSE ADVERTISING, so right away I am suspicious of any claims associated with these items.  They are also quite small.  The largest one, in its resting state, measures a hair more than 6 inches long, not including the ineffectual ball strap; the head is about 1.5"" diameter.  The inner cavity is about an inch in diameter by exactly 5 inches long, so any claims that this will add 3 inches of length are patently false.  It is quite stretchy, and would probably fit over just about any girth.  It may add a bit of texture, but isn't going to increase your size by much.  The little vibrator is strong, single speed as noted by others, but there's no way to replace the battery, or even to remove it easily, so after it dies it becomes a piece of toxic garbage.  You could probably insert some other tiny bullet vibe in the little slot, haven't tested this.

Admittedly I felt a little sheepish receiving the reminder in my email - ""Please rate your purchase of 100 One Condoms"" But I don't have a lot going on today, so I hope this helps all you lovers out there who wear your jimmy coats.I got one of these free in a gay village in Cape Cod a while back after watching a fat tranny who looked like Marilyn Monroe perform and tried it on for size. I really liked it and kept the brand name in my mind. Turns out you could get 100 on Amazon!! You know what that means. 100 rounds of intimacy. Or just a ton of condoms in a somewhat shady mail bag that stay in your closet for a few years until you forget about them and one day your mom asks you where her remote control is for that old dusty TV in the basement and you say ""one sec mom I think its in here"" and you start tearing through your closet until a tidal wave of contraceptives spill out across the floor. Oh jeez.Well, I only ended up using one of them ironically. For their intended purpose, that is.But what a magical evening. I like the fit and feel of this brand. It is snug and sturdy like a good pair of hiking boots. At 100-count for the price, you can't beat 'em. They have tons of random designs on the wrappers too - rubber ducky, basketball, strawberries. I guess those things make you feel sexy.Sadly, the other 99 expired over time because I was not having much luck with the ladies. But I ended up using them for lots of random experiments and crafts. I filled a bunch with water and froze them and made dong-shaped ice cubes. I pumped one with lotion and slapped my friend across the face and then played soccer with it for a brief time.Whatever you end up doing with them they will perform beyond your expectations.",5.0

5145,B004GLPA3Q,Bought these originally as a party favor for my b-day party and since I have used trustex before i thought this was a great buy. Well luckly I was so busy arranging other things that i forgot to include these in my goody bags because these things are an STD waiting to happen. First of all the flavoring apparently isn't all that great my partners really hated it but thats nothing compared the fact they are extremely flimsy!!!!! While having sex 2 of these broke in a row and let me tell u something like this is completely unacceptable!!!!! I have never had condoms break before but this was a back to back incident. exp date was fine not expired. Thanks to these things i will be a nervous wreck for the next six months as i get tested for any STDs and thats hoping for the best since anything other than that would be DEVASTATING!!! (HIV) I would never buy trustex again for would I think about giving these to others. Straight to the trash they went. Wish me luck. :(,1.0

5153,B000BH7870,"Well first off, I've tried several brands (latex only) and this is my personal second best choice after Kimono brand condoms. The Trojan Ultra thins are extremely comfortable, well-lubricated, secure (non-accidental-slip proof) and MADE IN JAPAN- just like the highly rated Crown,Kimono,and Beyond Seven condoms!! Japanese manufacturing practices/facilities are of the highest standards and cleanliness.I have never had these condoms break on me before-never. They are snug at the base, however, this is why they are ""non-accidental-slip proof."" A snug base is very reassuring on a standard-sized condom. Although the ultra-thin layer is not as thin as the Kimono condoms, it still feels like almost nothing at all and the heat transfer is superb. I personally have switched to this brand and I order this it from TARGET. DO NOT BUY FROM ""CONDOMMAN"" I highly recommend against it- you want something that is shipped in its original box; sealed, secure, and legitimate. Not a bag of condom links or individual packages. Most of the time, cheaper variations will be made in countries like Thailand, India, or Pakistan to cut costs. DO NOT!! buy condoms from countries listed above. Reading hundreds of reviews before going with these, I've learned that most of the condoms that break, discolor or tear are the ones made in these countries- hot climates, poor manufacturing practices, and unsanitary workplace conditions. I suggest buying condoms where it specifically states- *made in USA or *made in Japan!!!! I Can't stress that enough!!!Trojan Ultra thin (non-spermicidal) Condoms:1) comfort- 92) ease of putting on- 73) fit (standard size)- 94) secure (grip at base)- 105) heat transfer- 86) sensitivity (thinness)- 97) lubrication- 9",5.0

As a matter of fact, when love's labor is losing its traction due to lack of lusty lubrication, then using one of these lubricated condoms will help the two of you to reengage and reinvigorate your lovemaking activities. For those of us who consider such amorous affairs the stuff of hours of mutually stimulating and exciting personal encounters, nature can sometimes fail us by running of of steam and juices. In such circumstances, use of one of these specially designed and lubricated condoms can be of immeasurable assistance in putting the lovemaking back on track and back into gear. Buying them in quantity also makes sense, so if you love to make love, and recognize sometimes nature doesn't necessarily know best, try using these and see how much they add to your staying power and ability to make it an entire afternoon of love and passion.

5181,B005GTV4U0,"My gf and I have been on a mission to test/ rate several different types of condoms and we stumbled upon the Sir Richard brand. We decided on the assortment pack to test out the different styles this brand has to offer. My gf loved the condom that was ribbed. The ""ribbed"" pattern the sir richard condom is a little more pronounced than its durex and trojan counterparts. I loved the ultra thin condom, as it felt like there was nothing there. As a male, my biggest complaint about condoms in general, is that the reduced sensation felt when you have one on. Using the ultra thin condom, I would say I could feel about 70% more than what I feel with a normal condom on. The dotted condom was fun to use but we only kept it on for 5mins. the ""pleasure dots"" were ok but not excellent.My only complaint with these sir richard condoms are that they too tight. I foresaw this problem before buying the condom. I normally use trojan magnums or The Legend made by One condoms and probably should have went for the larger condom that Sir Richards makes...if I was concerned about fit. But to be honest, though larger condoms fit me better, they often don't feel better. I find them to be boring, as they don't tend to make larger condoms fun. These condoms were fun but keep in mind if you are above average in girth, they will be tight on you.",4.0

One is yellow, the other is clear.1 bottle of LAVA Libido Enhancer pills for women.  It contains 60 tablets.1 Dr. Honn's Famous Erection Ring for men.  I have never seen anything like this.  It looks like something a heroin addict would tie around their arm to get a vein ready, but it's actually a ""ring"" with two adjustable beads on each end, that you can slide down for a better fit.1 Multi-Speed Vibrating Bullet.

I'm not a big guy, but i'm not small either and so even with pinching the tip before putting it on, in the process of intercourse the lack of air and space pretty much tore right through this.

Use that information as you will, according to your own needs regarding sensitivity - I know different men have different needs in this area. For example, I could imagine a scenario in which a guy has no trouble maintaining erection, but is extremely sensitive and maybe because of that finishes a bit on the quick side. In that kind of case these would probably be great because they would reduce the stimulation for the pitcher - so to speak - while increasing the stimulation for the catcher, just remember to lubricate well.",4.0

They are both coated on the outside with flavored lube and made from flavored latex for flavor that just lasts and lasts. The flavors themselves are all enjoyable and kissed with just a hint of sweetness without being very sweet.The only drawbacks with these condoms are that they are both fairly thick and not lubricated on the inside. Of course, this means that you can use your favorite enhancing lube on the inside and  that the condoms will hold up well under stress, though the sensation isn't as sharp as it could be when the condoms are used as is.These condoms are a great value for safer sex or just those tired of always applying and reapplying flavored lubricants.

5615,B00K3RIG2Y,"Works great for water intercourse, and anal. Only issue is that it's a little sticky, so you'll want a towel for your hands, and you'll want to clean up afterwards in the shower, but other than that it's great.",5.0
5616,B00K3RIG2Y,"As a not extremely experienced person in the lubricant world, let alone silcone lubricants, I really can't comment too much compared to other brands or how it should feel. I did choose this brand based on numerous recommendations from outside sources that says System Jo is the best for anal, and is also a premium quality lubricant that is safe to use on more sex toys than other brands of lubricant. It is more expensive compared to other brands. I recently tried another brand that was half as expensive per ounce and from our experience with just skin to skin contact it felt comparable. We haven't yet tried it for traditional intercourse and likely won't use it for that often when we do, so the purpose of our purchase might be a bit different than the typical purchase.All that being said, when it comes to the experience of using it, I'm willing to spend a few extra bucks to make sure we have the highest rated, best lubricant for anal or shower sex. I can't feel the difference in massages or other, but maybe my wife can. And if there is the slightest chance that by using the highest quality bottle of lubricant, we can avoid even one tight pull on skin, or extra raw rubbing, or even just make it 1/10th smoother then the extra money is worth it.However, I can't confirm any of it, because like I said, I couldn't feel the difference. Still, our experience using it so far has been highly enjoyable, and long lasting... (or at least as long as we could last, the lube outlasted us) and it leaves a great silky smooth feeling after, not greasy or sitcky like a lotion or water based lube will. The only difference I could feel was in my pocketbook when making the purchase. So if you feel the risk/reward weighs the same with you as I described, then I would recommend buying this bottle for those special occasions and then a larger, cheaper bottle for more daily use. Just to be on the safe side.",5.0
5617,B00K3RIG2Y,"I am a huge fan of this lube and have been using this kind for some time now. It doesn't dry out and everything stays lubed for what seems like ever! We use this silicone lube for things like wands, plugs, shower sex, and this brands water based for sex when we want super slippery. I wasn't a fan of shower sex till we tried this silicone lube. It doesn't wash away as easily as water based or natural lubricants. I always have a big bottle beside the bed and a smaller size for on the go.",5.0

5852,B00BISKDXM,"This is a decent toy for the price, decent for even twice what I paid. The soft to the touch tip is a must have for me. The motor is a tad nosiy but can be masked by some sexy music. I would have to disagree with the reviews docking stars because the unit is weak,  I find it sufficient for my needs. I would highly recommend this product to any solo player or couple, especially beginners. If you want a four and a half inch V-8 engine powered on one AA battery don't buy this product.",4.0

I would definitely recommend this for anyone. The different settings and speeds are fantastic. You control how much or how little vibration to use. Highly recommend! My hubby enjoys using it on me too!,4.0

It has such powerful vibration, yet it is not too loud. The gel is very soft and comfortable. There is a simple button on the side you press to turn it on/off. I found that the battery has lasted longer than it was said to. Outstanding product!",5.0

I had the product less than two weeks when it suddenly stopped working.  So I purchased a new battery.  That was not the issue.The product was defective and so I emailed the seller, GREEN WEB PROPERTIES.THey REFUSED to assist me in any way.THey refused to stand by their product.The only thing they suggested was to contact the maker of the product telling me their phone number was printed on the box.When I had emailed them back to tell them they were wrong and the phone/email was NOT on the box, and asking them to supply the contact info, they refused.  I have never heard from them again!Nice customer service GREEN WEB PROPERTIES.So, now I have a product that I had spend good money on, and was not working after just two weeks.I really wish they would do the right thing...if they were really reputable, they would have at least replied and given me the contact info.  I had actually hoped they would have changed their minds and done something for me, but so many weeks have gone by and still nothing.It pains me to write such a nasty review, but they have just left me no choice.",1.0

I'm disappointed it broke so easily, but since it was only like $7, I'll probably be getting a replacement.",4.0

Instead of returning it and dealing with that process, I just kept it thinking Id enjoy the others. Its now been 3 months later and Ive thrown all 3 away. Just didnt like the feel of them compared to the Jenna haze swallow. I think I need to stick with the regular ones or something...",3.0

However, make no mistake; flavored or not, these are high quality latex condoms, each of them being lubricated with a reservoir tip, with a range of interesting flavors; Chocolate, Banana, Strawberry, Grape, or Mint.

6062,B001F1U5MQ,"I've tried my different brands of condoms and found these to be the best,for me. They have the right amount of lubrication and a nice snug fight,not too tight, nor too loose. My wife is very sensitive to condoms. We have found that these work for us without complaint.",5.0
6063,B001EJ5XE4,"Very cheap condoms and very reliable. One of the best deal I could find on amazon. This is my favorite brand of condoms.According to my girlfriend, the taste isn't very good. I also think they smell kind of weird.I feel like Lifestyles has pretty tight condoms compared to some other brands.But, I will definitely recommend these condoms for their price and reliability.",4.0

6069,B001BE3ACY,I ordered from this place 2 of the same product.  I was charged for two and sent only one.  I contacted them by email and never recieved a response.  I called the phone number but it was just a recording.  Left a message and no response.  Do not trust this seller .  Unfortunately I did not find them through amazon so did not have amazon to help out.  From now on I will always order my condoms through amazon and never from CondomMan!,1.0
