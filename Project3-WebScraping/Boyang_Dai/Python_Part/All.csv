If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break.

If you\'re unsure about whether you like these specifically I\'d suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don\'t already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren\'t fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don\'t try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that\'s too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don\'t have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that\'s a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you\'re not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn\'t count on the lubrication as it\'s more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.\n', u'\n  excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.\n', u""\n  My boyfriend and I are very happy with these condoms. He doesn't feel choked and I can hardly feel them. No issues at the moment. If your man is larger than most go with these.

Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!\n', u""\n  Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.

I guess the only way to know for each person is to try it out for yourself.\n"", u""\n  I was kinda nervous about putting that chemical on my penis but it wasn't that bad like other reviews say. Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.\n"", u'\n  This product definitely does what it\'s supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""', u""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job)."", u'For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don\'t already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn\'t recommend that you use these.  You might find out the ""hard?"" way that you don\'t really need any extra help.\n', u'\n  Never had condoms break before I\'ve tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same ""procedure"", ""preparation"", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.\n', u""\n  Good condom brand. I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!\n"", u""\n  I picked these ones because of the amazon coupon you can clip but I'm glad I did."", u""The dots and ribs ad lots of pleasure for her and honestly these are the best quality condoms I've ever used, these things stretch like crazy without breaking."", u'Definitely recommend!\n', u'\n  Every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it.

Would recommend to anyone with sensitive/reactive skin.\n', u""\n  Did a bit of shopping to prepare for the upcoming winter. Got a jacket, scarf and these gloves... Very confused by the packaging. Why are they individually wrapped? I've got two hands! The materials are also rather odd. Very slippery and doesn't seem well insulating. There must of been budget cuts at the factory after dealing with all the individual packaging because there's no finger holes! 0 out of 10 would not recommend. But I'm giving 5 stars just because I admire how unbreakable this weird thin stuff is.\n"", u""\n  This box is ok if you want to try lifestyles variety in non-laytex. I am allergic to laytex so these are great and actually feel better than regular laytext condoms. However, within this variety box me and my bf found that the extra lubricated (inside and outside condom) ones where just a pain in the ass! (no pun intended , heheheh), they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful! we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn't come off and it was more of a mood killer. The other condoms in the box are great and stay put!\n"", u""\n  I absolutely love this brand of condoms and won't be ordering any other brands in the future. They feel very comfortable and thin, and I haven't had one break yet. Unlike normal condoms they don't have that gross rubber smell. They're also perfect for people like me who have a latex allergy, and the ribbed condoms feel amazing! Extra lube is also pretty good. If you're not sure what type to get I'd try their variety pack.\n"", u""\n  Feels like the real thing. Not pregnant, none have broken. Great replacement for hormonal birth control and inexpensive.

The BareSkin condoms are utterly amazing.  I\'ve previously only used the Magnum Thin condoms but even they sometimes (maybe even frequently) lead to such a reduction in sensitivity that gladly kills my boner.  Sure, you\'re always going to know you\'re wearing a condom but these let me feel everything, seemed to go with the movement, and seemed to be a little looser than other Magnum condoms.  Given how impossibly thin the BareSkin condoms are, the bit of extra wiggle room - whether perceived or actual - probably contributes to its strength.  If a normal sized condom feels snug and you have $8, there\'s ZERO reason to not try these.  I mean, who says, ""I wish the latex was a little bit thicker.""??\n', u""\n  I wish they had these when I was in college! I've always hated condoms and I must have tried over 30 different brands and types over the years. These ones though I am happy with! (Well, as happy as someone can be when using them that is.) They fit well, you can feel a bit more than with other condoms, and the price is right. Just be sure to use a good lube!\n"", u""\n  My girlfriend commented on these during our first use! She asked me if I was using a different condom, and that it felt amazing! I used to use the Trojan Magnum Thin, but these are WAY thinner, and let you feel WAY more.

Almost as much as I hate hormonal contraception.  However, with a two-year-old and a two-month-old at home, my husband positively refuses to come anywhere near me without one.  By luck, when I first went shopping for condoms a month ago, I purchased these.  They were AWESOME.  I decided condoms weren't so bad after all.  However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.  (Obviously, I'm new to this, so I wasn't up-to-speed yet on the differences between latex and lambskin condoms.)  There is simply no comparison.  I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.  They're worth every penny.  Just look at it this way:  You could purchase thousands of these, and they'd still be less expensive than a child.  :)\n"", u""\n  After having our first baby, I didn't want to take any form of hormone contraception.  Unfortunately, traditional latex condoms were really uncomfortable for me.  We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)"", u""We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.  I'm not aiming to get pregnant with a 6.5-month-old infant at home, and we are happy that these condoms have been the key to allowing my husband and me to keep the love-light burning.  :)"", u""Edit:  After nearly four months of use, we've found that the condoms aren't all the same size.  Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.  They're a bit pricy (compared to latex), so that's unfortunate.  Even so, I definitely wouldn't let that stop me from buying another box!  They are definitely the best!\n"", u'\n  Without a doubt these suckas keep my dude piston feeling all natural.  Latex just desensitizes the junk, while the skin-to-skin feels awesome!  Boom!  Nearest to wearing nothing, these jimmy hats are the Real Deal Holyfield!', u'Church\n', u""\n  My partner and I can hardly feel these at all. I gave up hormonal birth control entirely, and now use only these, and they have worked perfectly. They transmit all the heat and feeling, and you don't have the problem with friction that you do with latex condoms."", u""My advice: They are a little harder to roll into place, but you can be a little rough with them to tug them down - they've never broken on us. Remember to leave room at the tip, and that these DON'T protect against HIV or other STDs.\n"", u'\n  It feels a bit odd rating this item, but I am doing so because someone needs to inform women about this product.  To be honest, I was extremely hesitant to try this product.  Husband and I are in our early forties and I have been informed by my physician to consider going off of birth control pills.  I was not open to having my tubes tied (nor the expense), nor did I want an IUD floating around inside me for years.  In addition, my husband was not open to having a vasectomy, as he is a physician and saw one too many men in his office w/difficulties from that procedure.  I ran across this Naturalamb product while shopping at a local pharmacy and took a stab at it.  For the record, my husband and I do not prefer to use condoms, but I took a stab at it and purchased a small box anyway.  Well, suffice it to say that neither I nor my husband have a single complaint about this product.  This product feels very, very natural.  I do  highly recommend.\n', u""\n  My vagina is basically allergic to everything. Almost everything sets off a yeast infection. I've tried every condom variation under the sun. Extra lube, no spermicide, non latex, lube free. These lamb skins do give me a slight reaction but it is by far the least bad reaction out of all the ones I've tried. I'll take that as a win.\n"", u'\n  My wife wanted to stop taking the pill, since she\'s been on it for most of her life. I wasn\'t real crazy about the idea of using condoms, but it was definitely my turn to shoulder some of the contraceptive responsibility. After trying these condoms, I have no problem using them for the rest of my reproductive days. These are definitely the best condoms ever made- the truly feel like you aren\'t wearing one at all. That would be the one downside, if there are any. My wife and I have had a few moments where we weren\'t sure if the condom was still on because it felt so ""natural.""

My wife likes them also and this is the only condom she likes.\n', u'\n  I\'ve used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don\'t roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a ""choking"" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren\'t so damn tight. For reference I\'m about 8.5"" long and 2"" wide (6.25"" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can\'t believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don\'t dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don\'t feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I\'m guessing that\'s because they are the ""thin"" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you\'re not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I\'d say if you\'re over about 7"" long or 6"" around (1.75"" wide) you should definitely give these a try.', u'FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn\'t have a single one rip, so I\'m not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I\'m guessing since they\'re the ""thin"" version maybe if you don\'t have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.\n', u'\n  ', u""You're probably going to try several different brands and types before finding the condom that's best for your situation.  While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried."", u'Trojan has another version in this line called the ', u'Trojan Magnum Ecstasy 3 Pack', u' that has the larger Magnum head for more ""wiggle"" room but with a base diameter that\'s between that of this Magnum Thin and that of Trojan ENZ.  This may be a good alternative if worried about the condom staying securely in place and depending on your situation that might be a good thing.  However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4"" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.

Men who want to know about this product want to know about two things:"", u'1.  Can a man with an above average or large penis wear this condom comfortably (aka, without being squeezed to death)? Yes...mostly', u'2.  Is this condom actually thinner?  In other words, can I have pleasurable sex with this thing? Absolutely YES', u'I\'m a larger guy who needs a bigger condom.  I\'ve been married for years.  I don\'t always wear a condom, but when I do, I wear Magnum.  Always.  Magnum is my brand because they don\'t strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should\'ve been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn\'t enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it\'s a little snug at the base....It doesn\'t seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I\'m not going to be the guy who says it feels like there\'s nothing on.  I mean, let\'s be honest:  If you\'re wearing a condom, sex isn\'t as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin\' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: ""Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.""  I thought so as well.  It is definitely thinner, and to put it courteously, fun was had by all.  If you need to wear a larger condom and you actually want to feel like you\'re having sex with a woman, then this is your condom.\n']","[u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0064FHD5A,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4 inches ; 2.1 ounces,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4 inches ; 2.1,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4

Lifestyles SKYN', u'4. NaturalLamb', u'The LELO fits well and does not slip. It seems slightly longer than average, but with an average width.  The sensation is very good.  The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.', u'Both the LELO and the Okamoto are better than the SKYN.  The NaturaLamb probably has the best sensation of any of these, but it is very expensive, fits like a baggie, and does not protect against STIs.', u'I highly recommend the LELO Hex. It is a long-overdue innovation.\n', u""\n  Let me start out by saying I am on certain medications that make it difficult to finish what I start - Especially when wearing condoms. The first thing I noticed, was this rolls on like a second skin. The fit is FANTASTIC! I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick. One partner reached multiple Oh's and described a very pleasurable experience with Lelo Hex. The sensations I felt allowed me to get where I wanted to go, too!"", u'You wont be dissappointed!\n', u""\n  These are the thinnest feeling condoms I have ever worn and feel great. I did not notice any special sensation from the raised inner hexagons and really cannot tell if they are any stronger because of it but there have been no tears so far. It's not the same as going bareback but this is as close as I have found, very happy with these.\n"", u'\n  These are awesome, ignore the lesbian that for some reason bought these. The condom is extra tight, which works great with the thin hexagonal latex. It seems the hexagons add friction so the condom is actually not moving during sex.\n', u'\n  Was not able to sense any changes to the fit, but the performance was very good with no stretching or breakage.  The line was decent and lasted a long time.', u'They were difficult to separate, the perforated end could be improved.  The different shape was interesting and rather small in diameter.  These did not have a horrible smell either, which was quite pleasant.', u'Each barrier did what they were supposed to do.\n', u""\n  This is the first change to the basic design in years and years, and it's a great success.  Unfortunately, this is marketed as a luxury item and carries a cost associated with luxury, putting it out of reach of the people who need it most.\n"", u'\n  Interesting design.

So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!', u""I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.

Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit."", u""I couldn't do it.

Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.\n"", u'\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it\'s worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don\'t roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They\'re the best I have ever used.\n', u""\n  Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.\n"", u""\n  I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n"", u""\n  I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk."", u'On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.', u'My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.', u'Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time.

I thought you put it over your fish bowl to make it easier to change the water.  You just snap it on, flip it over and BAM, done.  But no, it\'s filled with actual Durex condoms.  Not being the wasteful type, I feng shuied them around in there, added some water and now Carlos has a styling new bachelor pad.  No more awkward search of the nightstand when he has over a lady-Beta.  He is literally, and I mean literally, swimming in condoms.  All in all, not what I expected but a high quality product.\n', u'\n  ""Life is like a condom fishbowl; you never know what you\'re going to get"" The packages don\'t seem to say what the condom type will be (lubed, studded, ultra thin, etc.) so it is always a surprise.\n', u""\n  Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .  I personally wish they weren't colored but I know that most flavored condoms are. All of them expire at leat three years out from the date I ordered them.  Some don't expire for 4. We are very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying them again.  Though it will probably be a while before we need to!\n"", u""\n  Whats going on Durex? I got my first bowl that didn't have a cover. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover. Despite there being a cover on all the pictures on Amazon.

The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower.

As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved."", u'One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you\'re ... y\'know ... ""oversized,"" you might find these too tight.

Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice.

Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.\n"", u""\n  Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:"", u""- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort."", u""- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation."", u'- They have no particular smell or flavour.', u""- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too."", u""I've also tried recently the Durex polyisoprene condoms (\u201cAvanti Bare\u201d or \u201dReal Feel\u201d, they can't seem to be able to decide on their marketing), but they were more expensive without offering any obvious benefit, so Skyn are the way to go.\n"", u""\n  Thicker than Durex Avanti, Durex Extra Sensitive, and Okamoto 0.004.

Disafisfied by how they feel we have tried a ton of them and settled on Skyn because I thought that was as good as it could get. After doing a bit of research online I found these and thought I would give them a try so I went to my local CVS to buy a 3 pack just to give them a go before buying in bulk. We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price. I will never go back to regular condoms. Doesn't protect against STDs but you shouldnt be out screwing some random chick anyways. Take it from someone who has lived both scenes.

It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk.

I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything.

These are only a fraction of the costs of the big name manufacturers and work just as well. I moved away from Trojans because they always felt too thick and gave off a bad smell.

Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you.

Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!\n', u""\n  Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.

Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.\n"", u'\n  This product definitely does what it\'s supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""', u""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job)."", u'For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don\'t already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn\'t recommend that you use these.  You might find out the ""hard?"" way that you don\'t really need any extra help.\n', u'\n  Never had condoms break before I\'ve tried this one.

They are too tight and end up effecting his ability to stay ... well ... effective.  Girth is the issue here rather than the length.  The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9"".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don\'t seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don\'t have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you\'re rolling in the dough.', u'I never had problem like that with past partners and was barely aware of the size of XL.  I finally broke down and researched enough to see if my husband was extra sensitive or extra large as the size indicates.  I learned that the girth size suggested for condoms according to www.condom-sizes.org are as follows:  (measure the girth at the midpoint of the erection):', u'Regular:  girth < 5.3""', u'Magnum:  5.3"" < girth < 5.5""', u'XL:  5.5"" < girth < 5.8""', u'out of luck: 5.8"" < girth', u'Much to my husband\'s annoyance, I forced a measurement and found him to have a 6.0"" circumference, average is somewhere around 4.8"".

Wasn't concerned with length, but need much more girth space.  Basically the same as wearing too small of a ring and seeing the color change.

Mine is 6 inches circumference and this condom will fit maximum only 5.5 inches and almost strangling the member in its base.', u'""XL"" is misleading, even when this might be the biggest Trojan condom.', u'FDA is doing a very unhealthy, dangerous and unintelligent job by limiting the size of condoms sold in the USA, specially in girth. Shame on them. European brands like ""MySize"", ""TheyFit"" and ""Pasante"" are built with similar quality standards as Trojan and they have much real larger sizes. The problem is that it is very difficult to get them.', u'By the way, compare the Magnum Trojan XL packaging size with another brand.

I\'ll tell you my size to put it in perspective: I\'m almost 7"" with above-average girth.  I\'m kind of big.  The large condoms fit me fine.  Hell, I\'m wearing the normal ones right now, and although the length is a little short, they\'re still wearable and fit comfortably.

Its like nothing is there... the only kind ill buy son... They are strong, and transfer heat so you feel the good stuff instead of a piece of latex... Buy them... they are a bit more expensive  but well worth the price...\n', u""\n  The three stars is only because the size of the base ring is much tighter than I expected after doing a lot of research and was expecting it to fit closer to a regular condom (maybe around 54 mm in width) and it was much tighter, and the three stars is not for the quality Sagami condom brand. For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers. For now for the times I use polyurethane condoms I will use the Okamoto 002 Large that fit closer to a regular condom because for me the base ring was too tight on these Sagami 002 Original.\n"", u""\n  These are great, a little bit tighter than what I am used to (normally use skyn or supra). Had to check and make sure it was still there a few times, not a bad thing. Work very well and I will certainly be buying more. I really want to try the .01, but I have only seen them in the smaller size which I don't think will work out for me.\n"", u'\n  Compared to wearing condoms off the self, the Sagami 002 is far superior.

Thinnest condom on the market (though I've heard of the elusive 0.01mm, but cannot find it)! Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one.

Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so..."", u'If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn\'t going to fit you. Others have said this, but I\'m going to clarify: if you\'re over 2"" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip\'s reservoir. I\'ve read that these condoms are ~1.4"" girth, but up to 2"", you\'ll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don\'t work out for you.\n', u""\n  The best condoms out there!

It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.\n"", u'\n  I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.', u'Size:', u'I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.', u'Shape:', u""They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that."", u'Lube:', u'The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.\n', u'\n  If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the ""ribbing"" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I\'ve ever encountered.  Frigging\' Yuck.\n', u""\n  These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.\n"", u""\n  Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.\n""]","[u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HRU9YDU,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4 inches ; 2.4 ounces,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4 inches ; 2.4,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4

They expire October 2019, and are from batch number T4Y4. I have no guarantee that the old batch was produced in Japan, but there is a slight chance. Condom Depot wrote an article (""Crown Condoms Thailand & Japan What\u2019s The Deal?"") regarding the differences between manufacturing locations, dated March 11, 2009. In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row. So do you think they sold 400,000 condoms in more than 19 months? The odds probably fall in that direction.

I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I\'ve been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can\'t offer much more insight regarding the man\' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don\'t think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it\'s the only kind they used with me and so they couldn\'t compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.\n']","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C350E2Y,0.3 ounces ( ),0.3,

After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it.

We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.\n"", u'\n  I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.', u'Size:', u'I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.', u'Shape:', u""They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that."", u'Lube:', u'The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.\n', u'\n  If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the ""ribbing"" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I\'ve ever encountered.  Frigging\' Yuck.\n', u""\n  These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.\n"", u""\n  Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.\n""]","[u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWMOOD4,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4 inches ; 2.4 ounces,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4 inches ; 2.4,3.1 x 1.6 x 5.4

Frankly, I think marketing and distribution are probably the only reason these aren't as well known as Trojans.

I'm just warning any of you who have read great reviews on these, because the ones made in Japan are actually really great. These Thailand condoms are cheap and stinky."", u""To be fair, the fit seems to be roughly the same (feels a bit tighter) and my girlfriend and I used one when we ran out of good condoms (durex super thin extra sensitive condoms) and it wasn't awful minus the really disgusting smell (major turn off). The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)"", u""Definitely go with the Durex extra sensitive on this one. They are a bit wider, they are just as thin as the Crown Skinless Skin, they have NO smell or taste, are lubed generously, and I've used hundreds of them with no breaks.\n"", u""\n  These just arrived and I haven't used them yet so this review is more to inform people about something that surprised me. Never having ordered this kind of thing in bulk, I assumed they'd come in a large Costco-style Okamoto/Crown box, or retail packaging of some kind. Instead they came in a plastic bag. It definitely weirded me out at first. When I thought about it I realized of course if you're buying them in bulk they'll arrive that way, it just startled me when I first saw it. All of these condoms appear to expire in 2017 so I have plenty of time to go through them. I will update once I've had the chance to use them (though god only knows when that will be *sigh*).\n"", u""\n  Made in Japan! What I thought these didn't exist anymore. The word on the street is that the ones made in Thailand aren't as good. Although I can't verify that because this is my first purchase. These condoms are awesome! Unfortunately though, I've only been able to use one in two weeks. \U0001f62d What the H!  At this rate they'll last forever. Maybe I'll just try them on for fun. Oh - I could learn how to tie balloon animals.\n"", u""\n  The condom is true to its name. Really feels like nothing is there. Also they are very inexpensive (100pk for 15 dollars) one thing to remember is that as stated on the label it is lightly lubricated. So it's best to apply some extra especially if you plan on going for more then 10 mins. Another thing if you have more girth or length then average you will realize that it can be a snug condom. I personally felt like it didn't roll down close enough to my base a problem I haven't had with any other condom\n"", u""\n  ...nothing at all...nothing at all! Pretty solid condom except for the fact that unless you get the girl wet enough, there will be some friction due to a lack of lubrication on these condoms. Other than that, they're pretty good.\n"", u'\n  They are not kidding about these being thin; they are as ""barely there"" as any condom I\'ve used (not that many now that I think about it).

There is no way one can go wrong with these condoms. They have been credited as being super thin which enhances balminess while at the same time performing their duty of protection.  Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.', u'Sex is a pleasurable moment and when a condom insinuates otherwise then there is a problem. Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.', u'With such an impressive track record and good reputation, Durex extra sensitive condoms are one of the safest condoms out there.

I previously ordered Skyn Large condoms in May 2016 and i fell in love with them. I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now."", u'In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India. Can I get answers as to whether they are counterfeit or real?', u'Thanks\n', u'\n  I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don\'t have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I\'ve been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can\'t offer much more insight regarding the man\' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don\'t think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it\'s the only kind they used with me and so they couldn\'t compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.\n']","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FEHW0B0,0.6 ounces ( ),0.6,

Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n"", u'\n  I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!', u""I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.

Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit."", u""I couldn't do it.

And trust me...I've been researching this for years!"", u""I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.\n"", u'\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it\'s worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don\'t roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They\'re the best I have ever used.\n', u""\n  Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.\n"", u""\n  I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n"", u""\n  I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk."", u'On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.', u'My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.', u'Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time.

If you\'re unsure about whether you like these specifically I\'d suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don\'t already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren\'t fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don\'t try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that\'s too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don\'t have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that\'s a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you\'re not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn\'t count on the lubrication as it\'s more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.\n', u'\n  excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.\n', u""\n  My boyfriend and I are very happy with these condoms. He doesn't feel choked and I can hardly feel them. No issues at the moment. If your man is larger than most go with these.

I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling."", u""So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.\n"", u'\n  Perfect.

And it's *almost* like you're not wearing anything, but there's no doubt that you are.  But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n"", u'\n  I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!', u""I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are."", u""Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit."", u""I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around."", u""I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!"", u""I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.\n"", u'\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it\'s worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don\'t roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They\'re the best I have ever used.\n', u""\n  Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.\n"", u""\n  I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n"", u""\n  I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk."", u'On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.', u'My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.', u'Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.\n']","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IMUGVE4,1.6 ounces ( ),1.6,

Practice with one before the first time you're with your partner to save some embarrassment.  I also wish there was a better reservoir tip; breakage hasn't been an issue but a better tip would be nice.  They are tight due to being polyurethane; it's really a personal preference if they're too tight for you."", u""If you're in the market for a non-latex condom your two best options are these and Lifestyles Skyn.  I recommend trying both to see which work better for you.\n"", u'\n  I have interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and vulvar vestibulitis, all of which make me very sensitive to condoms and lubricants. While I do not have a latex allergy, I find that latex condoms irritate my conditions. Additionally, I typically can\'t tolerate the lubricants that come on condoms, but I could not find a non-latex, non-lubricated condom. After doing some research, I discovered that polyurethane condoms are superior to polyisoprene because they can conduct temperature better and are thinner. I decided to give these a try despite the lubricant and found that I tolerate them very well. My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to ""bare back"" sex than any other condom and I don\'t have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI\'s afterward. Also, I can use non-water based lubricants that I find more effective and gentle and not worry about compromising the integrity of the condom. We won\'t use any other condom now.\n', u'\n  yay! no kids yet!', u""Aside from that this is as good as it gets.  I've tried many brands and types, this is the one for me.

Aside from that, it's still a 5 star product. Easy to open since all sides are designed to be able to be teared open. The only issue, that can be personally fixed, is the lubricant amount.

Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem.

Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.\n"", u'\n  This product definitely does what it\'s supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""', u""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job)."", u'For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don\'t already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn\'t recommend that you use these.  You might find out the ""hard?"" way that you don\'t really need any extra help.\n', u'\n  Never had condoms break before I\'ve tried this one.

The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break.

No complaints on either end with these great condoms.', u""As an addition, sex is often more enjoyable with some extra lubricant.  I have found that when he is using a condom with ribs, it tends to need some extra lubricant to keep me from getting a bit sore or raw.

Also keep in mind some ladies have allergies to latex, so never use these with a woman who does."", u'I also want to add that those of you gents who do use lube, that you use water based so as not to cause a condom failure and put everyone at risk.', u'For those of you who explore more non-traditional sex, make sure to take your time, use lots of lube, go slow and lubricate multiple times.  These condoms work well for this too, just take it easy.', u'One last thing, for you gents to remember, these do have an expiration date, so keep them current, keep them handy, and keep some lube with you as well.', u'So gentleman, do the right thing and get some to keep with you, and keep you and your partner safe.

If you\'re unsure about whether you like these specifically I\'d suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don\'t already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren\'t fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don\'t try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that\'s too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don\'t have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that\'s a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you\'re not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn\'t count on the lubrication as it\'s more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.\n', u'\n  excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good.

The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.', u'Both the LELO and the Okamoto are better than the SKYN.  The NaturaLamb probably has the best sensation of any of these, but it is very expensive, fits like a baggie, and does not protect against STIs.', u'I highly recommend the LELO Hex.

The first thing I noticed, was this rolls on like a second skin. The fit is FANTASTIC! I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick.

It's not the same as going bareback but this is as close as I have found, very happy with these.\n"", u'\n  These are awesome, ignore the lesbian that for some reason bought these. The condom is extra tight, which works great with the thin hexagonal latex.

The line was decent and lasted a long time.', u'They were difficult to separate, the perforated end could be improved.  The different shape was interesting and rather small in diameter.  These did not have a horrible smell either, which was quite pleasant.', u'Each barrier did what they were supposed to do.\n', u""\n  This is the first change to the basic design in years and years, and it's a great success.  Unfortunately, this is marketed as a luxury item and carries a cost associated with luxury, putting it out of reach of the people who need it most.\n"", u'\n  Interesting design.

Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .

I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them.

Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n"", u'\n  I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!', u""I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.

Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit."", u""I couldn't do it.

And trust me...I've been researching this for years!"", u""I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.\n"", u'\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it\'s worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don\'t roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They\'re the best I have ever used.\n', u""\n  Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.\n"", u""\n  I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n"", u""\n  I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk."", u'On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.', u'My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.', u'Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time.

I was happy with the selection I got-- it did include all the brands they listed, 2 or 4 of most kinds and a good handful of Crowns which are probably a cheap filler but good nonetheless.  I was happy that only 2 types of Trojan condoms were included because they have been a disappointment to us in the past. After trying out several kinds we have both figured out what we do and don't like, and once these are gone I can buy our favorites in bulk.  It has been exciting to try out all the different kinds that are new to us such as textured, different sizes, colors, shapes, and even glow in the dark. The only heads-up is that these, like most bulk condoms on Amazon, are shipped loose in a padded envelope.  Doesn't hurt to give them a quick look-over especially if the envelope looks like it has handled rough.  All of ours were just fine.  Overall very happy with this purchase.\n"", u'\n  This was exactly what I wanted: a large assortment of brands and variations to try.

Great for bigger guys, there\'s room and it is tapered at the bottom so it stayed on great.\n', u""\n  My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.\n"", u'\n  I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.', u'Size:', u'I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.', u'Shape:', u""They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that."", u'Lube:', u'The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.\n', u'\n  If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the ""ribbing"" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I\'ve ever encountered.  Frigging\' Yuck.\n', u""\n  These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.\n"", u""\n  Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.\n""]","[u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045ENSJ2,3.1 x 1.7 x 5.4 inches ; 2.1 ounces,3.1 x 1.7 x 5.4 inches ; 2.1,3.1 x 1.7 x 5.4

They expire October 2019, and are from batch number T4Y4. I have no guarantee that the old batch was produced in Japan, but there is a slight chance. Condom Depot wrote an article (""Crown Condoms Thailand & Japan What\u2019s The Deal?"") regarding the differences between manufacturing locations, dated March 11, 2009. In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row. So do you think they sold 400,000 condoms in more than 19 months? The odds probably fall in that direction. Anyway, let\'s see if this unnecessarily thorough review helps anyone!', u""Sensation: The older batch seems to have a slight better sensation to it, but they're both so similar that it is extremely difficult to tell."", u'Thickness: Placing the two, still rolled, side by side, the older batch seems to be ever so slightly thinner. This goes against the article from Condom Depot, as they state those manufactured in Japan are 0.005mm thicker than those made in Thailand. Curious about this, I tried measuring two others that were still in their packaging. Keep in mind that I have a crappy $15 digital caliper, but the old batch came to 3.31mm, and the new batch 3.46mm. I tried not to squish them, so I based my measurements off of how much drag I felt when removing the caliper after measuring.', u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  Arrival was timely and fit is snug but not painful. Not planning a bedroom marathon with these so they're fine for now. They do feel more like bare skin than anything else tried, but the light lubrication didn't seem like it was there at all.

Still, they're liked and not a bad purchase for a small tester pack.\n"", u""\n  From a female perspective these are by far the greatest condoms out there. It feels almost like there's nothing at all between us. These are way better than the ultra thins on the market.

It's also relatively thin, along the lines of .0042 thickness, if I recall correctly. You can get .002 and .002 thickness with other Japanese brands, however the price increases exponentially and the availability decreases as well. Crown is a wonderful go-between, but do be careful regarding the manufacturing locations."", u""Many years ago I purchased them when they were the original silver and blue packaging. They were thin and barely felt like they were there. These new blue and white packets feel thicker to me for some reason, though it could be because I went for a period without the need for condoms, and now that things have changed, it's hard adapting back to the ole latex."", u""I've used MANY of these condoms and have not had one failure.

Almost as much as I hate hormonal contraception.  However, with a two-year-old and a two-month-old at home, my husband positively refuses to come anywhere near me without one.  By luck, when I first went shopping for condoms a month ago, I purchased these.  They were AWESOME.  I decided condoms weren't so bad after all.  However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.  (Obviously, I'm new to this, so I wasn't up-to-speed yet on the differences between latex and lambskin condoms.)  There is simply no comparison.  I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.  They're worth every penny.  Just look at it this way:  You could purchase thousands of these, and they'd still be less expensive than a child.  :)\n"", u""\n  After having our first baby, I didn't want to take any form of hormone contraception.  Unfortunately, traditional latex condoms were really uncomfortable for me.  We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)"", u""We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.  I'm not aiming to get pregnant with a 6.5-month-old infant at home, and we are happy that these condoms have been the key to allowing my husband and me to keep the love-light burning.  :)"", u""Edit:  After nearly four months of use, we've found that the condoms aren't all the same size.  Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.  They're a bit pricy (compared to latex), so that's unfortunate.  Even so, I definitely wouldn't let that stop me from buying another box!

Remember to leave room at the tip, and that these DON'T protect against HIV or other STDs.\n"", u'\n  It feels a bit odd rating this item, but I am doing so because someone needs to inform women about this product.  To be honest, I was extremely hesitant to try this product.  Husband and I are in our early forties and I have been informed by my physician to consider going off of birth control pills.  I was not open to having my tubes tied (nor the expense), nor did I want an IUD floating around inside me for years.  In addition, my husband was not open to having a vasectomy, as he is a physician and saw one too many men in his office w/difficulties from that procedure.  I ran across this Naturalamb product while shopping at a local pharmacy and took a stab at it.  For the record, my husband and I do not prefer to use condoms, but I took a stab at it and purchased a small box anyway.  Well, suffice it to say that neither I nor my husband have a single complaint about this product.  This product feels very, very natural.  I do  highly recommend.\n', u""\n  My vagina is basically allergic to everything. Almost everything sets off a yeast infection. I've tried every condom variation under the sun.

I'll take that as a win.\n"", u'\n  My wife wanted to stop taking the pill, since she\'s been on it for most of her life. I wasn\'t real crazy about the idea of using condoms, but it was definitely my turn to shoulder some of the contraceptive responsibility. After trying these condoms, I have no problem using them for the rest of my reproductive days. These are definitely the best condoms ever made- the truly feel like you aren\'t wearing one at all.

Yeah, these condoms may be expensive, but consider the upside: you won't mind putting them on, and you could be saving yourself large bills from a disease/pregnancy."", u'Now to the other people who have reviewed this product: are you all porn stars??!  I\'ll tell you my size to put it in perspective: I\'m almost 7"" with above-average girth.  I\'m kind of big.  The large condoms fit me fine.  Hell, I\'m wearing the normal ones right now, and although the length is a little short, they\'re still wearable and fit comfortably.  I would take the other reviewers\' opinions with a grain of salt as I have had zero issues wearing these.\n', u'\n  Dude, you can barely feel them... Its like nothing is there... the only kind ill buy son... They are strong, and transfer heat so you feel the good stuff instead of a piece of latex... Buy them... they are a bit more expensive  but well worth the price...\n', u""\n  The three stars is only because the size of the base ring is much tighter than I expected after doing a lot of research and was expecting it to fit closer to a regular condom (maybe around 54 mm in width) and it was much tighter, and the three stars is not for the quality Sagami condom brand. For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers. For now for the times I use polyurethane condoms I will use the Okamoto 002 Large that fit closer to a regular condom because for me the base ring was too tight on these Sagami 002 Original.\n"", u""\n  These are great, a little bit tighter than what I am used to (normally use skyn or supra). Had to check and make sure it was still there a few times, not a bad thing. Work very well and I will certainly be buying more. I really want to try the .01, but I have only seen them in the smaller size which I don't think will work out for me.\n"", u'\n  Compared to wearing condoms off the self, the Sagami 002 is far superior.

Thinnest condom on the market (though I've heard of the elusive 0.01mm, but cannot find it)! Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one.

Others have said this, but I\'m going to clarify: if you\'re over 2"" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip\'s reservoir. I\'ve read that these condoms are ~1.4"" girth, but up to 2"", you\'ll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don\'t work out for you.\n', u""\n  The best condoms out there!

Also, taking them off is difficult unless you wait to ""down size"".', u'Other than the above they are great.\n', u'\n  I love these things! Sometimes they feel a big too snug, and if you aren\'t completely erect it\'s hard to get on due to the tightness. However, once it is on it\'s an awesome experience. The polyurethane is great because it doesn\'t stretch out as much, it stays right where it is and enables a more ""natural"" feeling. The only downside to that is that it isn\'t particularly elastic, so if it does start stretching out a bit (generally from things getting too dry) it doesn\'t go back to its original shape. Because of this, we\'ll generally just take it off and throw a fresh one on. But I still prefer it to latex, hands down.', u'If you use this and pair it with a good lubricant (I use Wet Platinum Premium), it\'s about as close to ""raw"" as your going to get in my experiences. The thinness of it and the material mixed with the tightness and the wetness of the lubricant really simulates the real thing nicely.  If you\'re in the ""larger"" department down there, don\'t get this. It\'s not going to be comfortable. But if you\'re average, this should do the trick.', u'I spent most of my sex life using birth control, and only recently went back to condoms, and it\'s hard to ""get into the mood"" when you have to throw one of these on, they reduce the feeling a lot too.

Thin but strong.  Easy to use.  Fit comfortably.  A lot of people think they provide the best sensation on the market.

Frankly, I think marketing and distribution are probably the only reason these aren't as well known as Trojans.

I'm just warning any of you who have read great reviews on these, because the ones made in Japan are actually really great. These Thailand condoms are cheap and stinky."", u""To be fair, the fit seems to be roughly the same (feels a bit tighter) and my girlfriend and I used one when we ran out of good condoms (durex super thin extra sensitive condoms) and it wasn't awful minus the really disgusting smell (major turn off). The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)"", u""Definitely go with the Durex extra sensitive on this one. They are a bit wider, they are just as thin as the Crown Skinless Skin, they have NO smell or taste, are lubed generously, and I've used hundreds of them with no breaks.\n"", u""\n  These just arrived and I haven't used them yet so this review is more to inform people about something that surprised me. Never having ordered this kind of thing in bulk, I assumed they'd come in a large Costco-style Okamoto/Crown box, or retail packaging of some kind. Instead they came in a plastic bag. It definitely weirded me out at first. When I thought about it I realized of course if you're buying them in bulk they'll arrive that way, it just startled me when I first saw it. All of these condoms appear to expire in 2017 so I have plenty of time to go through them. I will update once I've had the chance to use them (though god only knows when that will be *sigh*).\n"", u""\n  Made in Japan! What I thought these didn't exist anymore. The word on the street is that the ones made in Thailand aren't as good. Although I can't verify that because this is my first purchase. These condoms are awesome! Unfortunately though, I've only been able to use one in two weeks. \U0001f62d What the H!  At this rate they'll last forever. Maybe I'll just try them on for fun. Oh - I could learn how to tie balloon animals.\n"", u""\n  The condom is true to its name. Really feels like nothing is there. Also they are very inexpensive (100pk for 15 dollars) one thing to remember is that as stated on the label it is lightly lubricated. So it's best to apply some extra especially if you plan on going for more then 10 mins. Another thing if you have more girth or length then average you will realize that it can be a snug condom. I personally felt like it didn't roll down close enough to my base a problem I haven't had with any other condom\n"", u""\n  ...nothing at all...nothing at all! Pretty solid condom except for the fact that unless you get the girl wet enough, there will be some friction due to a lack of lubrication on these condoms.

Every time I use them I feel very uncomfortable, like they never seem to fit right, or the specified ""effect"" or ""special lubricant"" or whatever never seems to stack up to their claims. To my knowledge i\'m not allergic to latex but with trojan condoms I seem to display qualities of a latex allergy without any of the more unpleasant side effects (swelling, inflamation, ect).', u""Being that I didn't know if latex was the problem I decided for the hell of it to try something else and since lamb skin are less effective percentage wise, my friend recommended these to me about 5 years ago. After seeing a commercial I finally gave in and bought a bulk pack of like 12 or whatever, and I haven't bought another brand since."", u'Not only are they extremely comfortable (as far as these type of products go) but they really do simulate the sensation of ""wearing nothing"" better than any other product on the market. Application and removal is a breeze. no bunching, snagging, pinching or any of those unpleasant problems posed by thick latex style products. And best of all they stretch and conform without ever losing their seal. Fantastic product.\n', u""\n  I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction. As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved."", u'One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you\'re ... y\'know ... ""oversized,"" you might find these too tight. My partner has this issue, and he\'s had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.\n', u""\n  Polyisoprene is extremely superior to latex in sensation and comfort, particularly in temperature transfer. Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice. Plus partners may be mildly irritated by latex and not be aware of it - using polyisoprene ensures a better chance of everyone having the best experience possible. Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.\n"", u""\n  Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:"", u""- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort."", u""- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation."", u'- They have no particular smell or flavour.', u""- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too."", u""I've also tried recently the Durex polyisoprene condoms (\u201cAvanti Bare\u201d or \u201dReal Feel\u201d, they can't seem to be able to decide on their marketing), but they were more expensive without offering any obvious benefit, so Skyn are the way to go.\n"", u""\n  Thicker than Durex Avanti, Durex Extra Sensitive, and Okamoto 0.004.

If you finish rolling down a standard condom and don't have much left, the Sagami will be short.

Disafisfied by how they feel we have tried a ton of them and settled on Skyn because I thought that was as good as it could get. After doing a bit of research online I found these and thought I would give them a try so I went to my local CVS to buy a 3 pack just to give them a go before buying in bulk. We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price. I will never go back to regular condoms. Doesn't protect against STDs but you shouldnt be out screwing some random chick anyways. Take it from someone who has lived both scenes.

My wife likes them also and this is the only condom she likes.\n', u'\n  I\'ve used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don\'t roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a ""choking"" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren\'t so damn tight. For reference I\'m about 8.5"" long and 2"" wide (6.25"" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can\'t believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don\'t dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don\'t feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I\'m guessing that\'s because they are the ""thin"" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you\'re not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I\'d say if you\'re over about 7"" long or 6"" around (1.75"" wide) you should definitely give these a try.', u'FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn\'t have a single one rip, so I\'m not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I\'m guessing since they\'re the ""thin"" version maybe if you don\'t have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.\n', u'\n  ', u""You're probably going to try several different brands and types before finding the condom that's best for your situation.  While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried."", u'Trojan has another version in this line called the ', u'Trojan Magnum Ecstasy 3 Pack', u' that has the larger Magnum head for more ""wiggle"" room but with a base diameter that\'s between that of this Magnum Thin and that of Trojan ENZ.  This may be a good alternative if worried about the condom staying securely in place and depending on your situation that might be a good thing.  However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4"" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.  Also, the Magnum Ecstasy version I tried had ""Warming and Tingling, Nonoxynol-9"" that left me feeling disconnected from the experience.', u""This Magnum has a water-based lubricant, protects against both STD's and unwanted pregnancy, and for me, this thin version provides the greatest comfort and intimacy of all the versions I've tried in the Magnum line.  I've never encountered bunching or breaking as reported in a few of the other reviews.  These have never let me down (no pun intended) and work well for my situation."", u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  Okay, I'd like to be as brief and as helpful as possible. Men who want to know about this product want to know about two things:"", u'1.  Can a man with an above average or large penis wear this condom comfortably (aka, without being squeezed to death)? Yes...mostly', u'2.  Is this condom actually thinner?  In other words, can I have pleasurable sex with this thing? Absolutely YES', u'I\'m a larger guy who needs a bigger condom.  I\'ve been married for years.  I don\'t always wear a condom, but when I do, I wear Magnum.  Always.  Magnum is my brand because they don\'t strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should\'ve been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn\'t enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it\'s a little snug at the base....It doesn\'t seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I\'m not going to be the guy who says it feels like there\'s nothing on.  I mean, let\'s be honest:  If you\'re wearing a condom, sex isn\'t as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin\' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: ""Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.""  I thought so as well.

Also, these condoms run small so I would not recommend them for bigger men.\n"", u'\n  With a little google search, I came upon these. Hate using condoms, but I can say that these are the best condoms I have used so far. Used trojan/durex in the past and prefer these. My wife says that she hardly feels them (which is great). I on the other hand, can feel the difference between having it on and not having it on for sure, but that comes with the use of any condom.

Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.  I hit the skins at least 4 times a week and I could practically be a spokesperson for these Jimmy's because I've used them so much.\n"", u'\n  Best condoms I have ever bought.

I previously ordered Skyn Large condoms in May 2016 and i fell in love with them. I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now."", u'In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India. Can I get answers as to whether they are counterfeit or real?', u'Thanks\n', u'\n  I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don\'t have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I\'ve been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can\'t offer much more insight regarding the man\' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don\'t think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it\'s the only kind they used with me and so they couldn\'t compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.\n']","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C350E2Y,0.3 ounces ( ),0.3,

It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk. I searched for the best price before I purchased, even looked here, and I felt the price there was already pretty good, add the free shipping and the discount and my mine was made."", u""Now as far as use goes, I thought the condom looked smaller than other condoms, but it slipped right on my sweetie with no problems. I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything. I got these condoms for HIM, because I wanted us to be protected but I wanted him to be able to feel as much as possible. I also noticed that there was no latex and sex smell after we were done."", u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  It feels like nothing's there because it probably broke.

These are only a fraction of the costs of the big name manufacturers and work just as well. I moved away from Trojans because they always felt too thick and gave off a bad smell. Durex was my preferred brand but they got more and more expensive. These feel thinner than both brands (which I worry about) but I have yet to have one fail on me.\n', u""\n  These used to be my favorite condoms.

I've never had one break on me and they really are thin. I'm fairly thick down there and have also not had any problems with that."", u'Furthermore, I have used these and extra thin Trojan condoms back to back and they were virtually identical experiences.\n', u'\n  These are thin as advertised so the feeling is nice. Packaging is easy to open, which makes an awkward situation less so.', u""However , when they say lightly lubricated they aren't joking.

Strongest condoms I have ever tried. Only one broke on me but only because I was trying to see how strong they were. They are also the thinnest I have tried, I don't feel them at all. Which makes their price even better. The one problem is lightly lubricated is a massive understatement. You WILL need extra lube.\n"", u""\n  Love it! I will forevermore buy Okamoto Beyond Seven condoms in packs of 50! They are great quility and stretch pretty big, I haven't been able to break one yet, short of using a needle to poke them. They came in the mail within a few days, every time I've bought this product I've bought on a Thursday/Friday and it gets here about Monday. I love it! Very satisfied customer.\n"", u'\n  My wife and I have tried several condoms and have found this one to be the most comfortable for the both of us.  Since condoms are a matter of personal preference, I can only say that I would recommend you give it a try to rule it out for yourselves -- but we consider this our go-to condom of choice.\n', u'\n  These condoms are some of the best I\'ve ever tried. I take girls home from the bars and clubs all the time and these work great! I don\'t know why people keep complaining of the lack of lubricant on these as they are lubed quite well compared to the skinless skins inside and out which makes them feel very comfortable. I also like the bluish tint they have to them it adds to the fun and it\'s better than the off/dull white that most other condoms have. One of the best things about these that I love is the fit as these are probably the best fitting condoms I\'ve ever tried before. I\'m a little over 7"" fully erect and they cover me up just fine without being too restrictive. They are nice and snug border line too snug but just enough to give your member some breathing room which makes me feel safe that it\'s staying in place and not going anywhere no matter how hard the party gets. For sensitivity I can honestly say that I can\'t tell I\'m wearing one when going at it which makes me not mind using a condom which I like because we all know that using a condom sucks. I can definitely tell the difference between the sheerlon and the regular latex condoms. These sheerlon condoms are smoother and stretch without the restricting feeling of regular latex. I\'ve never had one break on me even when the going was rough and dry. I\'m glad I tried these because these are my go to condom for casual encounters and I would probably be paying at least two girls child support and maybe of had a few STD\'s if I wouldn\'t have used these. And you can\'t beat the price either, they\'re cheaper than Trojan and Durex and feel way better.\n', u""\n  These won the top vote in a personal fit test of a variety of condoms, and they have the added benefit of being ridiculously cheap. They've never slipped or failed. My go-to choice. They're packaged in a clear plastic bag.\n"", u'\n  Beyond Seven is the best for sensation and reliability.  But I knew that already.  When ordering in quantity like this, expiry is what matters.  I just received my order and expiration was in 2019.

As a woman writing this, you can be assured I am completely honest.  Hormonal birth control works in that it kills my normally healthy sex drive so we often use condoms."", u'My husband can\'t use regular condoms.  Period.  They are too tight and end up effecting his ability to stay ... well ... effective.  Girth is the issue here rather than the length.  The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9"".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don\'t seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don\'t have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you\'re rolling in the dough.', u'I never had problem like that with past partners and was barely aware of the size of XL.  I finally broke down and researched enough to see if my husband was extra sensitive or extra large as the size indicates.  I learned that the girth size suggested for condoms according to www.condom-sizes.org are as follows:  (measure the girth at the midpoint of the erection):', u'Regular:  girth < 5.3""', u'Magnum:  5.3"" < girth < 5.5""', u'XL:  5.5"" < girth < 5.8""', u'out of luck: 5.8"" < girth', u'Much to my husband\'s annoyance, I forced a measurement and found him to have a 6.0"" circumference, average is somewhere around 4.8"".  That would be indicative of the measurement suggestions that XL is still to small.', u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  I got these because other claimed XL condoms were too restricting and blocked blood flow.  Wasn't concerned with length, but need much more girth space.  Basically the same as wearing too small of a ring and seeing the color change.

Mine is 6 inches circumference and this condom will fit maximum only 5.5 inches and almost strangling the member in its base.', u'""XL"" is misleading, even when this might be the biggest Trojan condom.', u'FDA is doing a very unhealthy, dangerous and unintelligent job by limiting the size of condoms sold in the USA, specially in girth. Shame on them. European brands like ""MySize"", ""TheyFit"" and ""Pasante"" are built with similar quality standards as Trojan and they have much real larger sizes. The problem is that it is very difficult to get them.', u'By the way, compare the Magnum Trojan XL packaging size with another brand.

Proceeds not only go towards donating condoms to those around the world who normally have no access to contraception, but they also seek to ensure a sustainable and long lasting impact by supporting organizations who train women to become healthcare professionals.  This gives them the opportunity to become independent in their communities which affords them a larger influence in key decision making, such as the actual use of contraception.', u""I feel good about this purchase not only because I know that my money is going to a good cause, but also because they actually work well.

I seriously recommend giving them a try. You will not be disappointed.\n"", u""\n  I hate condoms, but I hate STD's more. This is the condom I've hated the least so far. There have been a few occasions I've wondered if it slipped off when it was still firmly attached. I'm not sure if that's because it's a great condom or because I drink too much. Either way, it's not terrible, in my book that makes this an excellent way to prevent syphilis and baby momma's.\n"", u'\n  I have discovered in the most uncomfortable way ever that I have a sensitivity to latex condoms and there fore can no longer use latex. I feared that I would never be able to use a condom and practice safe sex. My doctor suggested latex alternative and I decided to look up the best brand and give that a try.

So stock up!\n', u'\n  *This is mainly from a female perspective.', u""These are my favorite condom. The extra lubricant is really nice because it helps make the process easier when it's time to get gong. It doesn't irritate me, it actually provides some relief. Being on birth control has made my fluids a bit more uncomfortable for intercourse unless i'm extremely wet. It's almost like it's more thin and watered down and it makes it easier to irritate me than normal. By having no ridges or bumps, it is really nice for when i'm feeling a bit more sensitive down there. My significant other likes these condoms better than most types, but of course says skin on skin is better( you can't really ever have it same now can you?)  It stays it shape once on and doesn't slide off. I've also never once had this type break on me and i've been using it for quite some time now.\n"", u'\n  I have been searching for the best condom for me to use. I am one of those many men who can not ejaculate in a condom. I found the Trojan: Bareskin, and it works perfectly, but I keep finding online posts where people said they had them rip; THAT IS THE LAST THING I WANT! I tried the original Lifestyles: SKYN, and I still had a hard time ejaculating, and then I tried these. The SKYN Extra-Lubricated  is a HUGE step up from the original! It feels very smooth on the shaft, and has completely eliminated that rubber-band feel that latex condoms have. It still takes a little longer to ejaculate, but when I do it feels awesome. It is not the same as a Trojan: Bareskin, because it feels different; these are two totally different types of condoms. The great news is that I have heard no read no posts of these ripping; that news alone is enough to make one ejaculate with joy.', u'The bottom line, do not by the regular SKYNS; spend the extra money, and buy the SKYNS: Extra-Lubricated. I hope this helps.\n', u'\n  I have an allergy to latex, so latex condoms have always been uncomfortable to use. These make it feel like there is nothing there. Amazing product.\n', u""\n  Personally, these are the best condoms we have ever used! My husband and I are not looking to have another baby just yet so while I am not on any BC pill we thought it would be wise to play it safe. We hardly use condoms and hate the smell and feel so I put in the research and decided to give these SKYN condoms a try and I don't think we will ever try another brand. No smell and for me it doesn't feel like he's wearing anything. He's mentioned that they are a little tight but that hasn't seemed to affect him.\n"", u""\n  Me and the husband are not trying to tget pregnant we have a 3 months old.

That was always a deal-breaker for Trojan and even LifeStyles, the latex stench. You couldn\'t get the smell off your fingers until two or three washings later.

Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you. This will create friction inside and friction is feeling. With a normal condom you have to rely on stretching to create this friction.

While most adults are familiar with male condoms, female condoms are virtually unknown. That is sad, because they are a really good idea. The female condom is a larger verson of the male condom, designed to be inserted into the vagina, and have the male penetrate in the usual fashion. There is a semi-solid but flexible ring at the closed (internal) end that helps keep the female condom in place during sex.', u""As a male, I don't particularly like male condoms. I realize they are good for safe sex, okay but not great for birth control, inexpensive, and widely available. However, they do have some serious limitations. First and foremost, they are not very comfortable. It has been pointed out, accurately IMHO, that male condoms can even be troublesome for men built larger than average, and that includes the larger  condoms. They can be quite uncomfortable, interfere with an erection, and be difficult to put on."", u'Second, they do interfere with sexual pleasure. The male organ, unlike its female counterpart, is far more sensitive to stimulation by friction than by warmth, pressure, or vibration. Male condoms seriously decrease stimulation by friction (which can be great if you need that). The old saw about ""showering in a raincoat"" is not far wrong.', u'The female condom solves both these problems. They are far more comfortable, especially for the ""bigger"" man, and they allow the male to experience the frictional stimulation that works best for him. They also allow the female to have control over the use of the condom, preserve the primary mechanics of stimulation for her as well, and can be far more fun to insert than a male condom is to put on.', u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u'\n  ', u'I ordered these to try them out. I had seen what I\'d say are about 2/3 to 3/4 positive reviews at all the sites I\'ve looked at, and a substantial number of negative reviews, again around 1/4 to 1/3. I knew already that what was pictured here was an FC1, and what is being sold is an FC2--so heads up that packaging is not as pictured (at the time of my purchase), and that\'s GOOD because you want the FC2, not the FC1. The later version has improvements including that it doesn\'t make the crinkly bag sound a lot of folks complained about. I had watched the instructional videos about insertion, and also read at the informational sites that you should try it about 3 times with self-insertion (I\'m a woman), before you should be getting the hang of inserting them. My partner was very into the idea of inserting it himself, and I had no objection. When I tried on my own at home, I felt very unsure if I\'d seated it/secured it as required. But when he did it--also after watching the video online--he nailed it the first time. I wonder if most of the negative reviews are tied to older versions (FC1) or not inserting it properly, because that thing was anchored in there securely and we had no trouble with it moving or coming out. It stayed put exactly as intended, and we did a number of stops and starts with the one we used. For my part of it, I really didn\'t even notice it. It felt like ""nothing."" At one point we were just laying in bed, and he asked how it felt just laying there with it in. I said I couldn\'t even notice it. When we removed it, I did feel the tug, which let me know it was in tight while we were using it, and had been inserted properly. For his experience, the jury is still out. He said that it he was having ""more sensations"" than he does with a male condom.', u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  After using one for the first time, my husband looked at me and said why don't more girls use these?

The male has to make sure to aim appropriately into the ring, or it obviously can't do its job.  So, you have to re-aim every time he comes completely out.

The ring that remains outside the vagina gives me more friction, stimulation, & pleasure during intercourse. I love that I can put it in before we even mess around so there is no momentum lost between foreplay and the main event. It's non latex which is great for me since I have a latex sensitivity. Also you can use any lube without worry. The female condom also protects against more stds that can be transmitted by skin to skin contact than traditional condoms by covering the outer skin of the vagina.

While they cost more than a typical Trojan brand condom, they were definitely worth the investment. They are not as lubricated as most condoms, which gives you the option to use your preferred lubricant without much extra mess. They are on the smaller side and a snug fit, but one might argue that it reduces any slippage during intercourse and thereby increases the sensation. We didn't take issue with it. The packaging is nice and discreet if you happen to pop one in your purse or pocket. ;)\n"", u'\n  Rarely review products myself, but a friend recommended this brand to me and I ordered it and have been very happy. I love the product and have subsequently recommended it to my friends. Really like the brand focus and messaging, as well as the focus on sustainable sourcing. prefer this to the normal things I find at a convenience store. Feels better, and I myself feel better knowing it has an added focus on the environment. with so many other products moving this way, seems overdue that condoms and sexual health products would as well.\n', u'\n  I try to buy sustainable products as much as possible, why not condoms? To be honest I didn\u2019t even know a fair trade condom was a thing\u2026but Sustain has showed me the way!

It basically fits like a regular US condom while being thinner at 0.04. The few condoms in this range in the US such as the Trojan Bareskin and Durex Avanti Bare Latex at about 52mm were way too tight at the base ring. The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower.

Also, the packaging is aesthetically pleasing (I like the pictures of nature) & made from recycled materials. I figure as long as you're going to use condoms, why not use them from a company that has a good corporate conscience?\n"", u""\n  These condoms are the the best! Especially the ultra thin. They are as effective, and perhaps even more comfortable than standard condoms. The packaging on these condoms is really stylish and doesn't look unattractive in my nightstand. Also, I am reassured by the fact that, unlike other condoms (i.e., trojan, durex), these condoms do not contain chemicals that can potentially cause cancer in women.\n"", u""\n  I appreciate the environmentally conscious efforts of Hollender with these products. From a practical standpoint they are functionally perfect and do what they are intended to do. Sensitivity remains high as far as condom sensitivity goes, but where these condoms excel is the confidence inspired through the use of chemical free lubricants and/or spermicides. As some reviewers have noted, the condoms fit a bit snugly, but I have no issues with the fit and actually prefer a snug fit for both, comfort and sensitivity. This is the first time I've tried this brand and will likely make my prefered choice going forward.\n"", u""\n  In the area of reproductive health and safety people are typically conscious about using condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs. However, most conventional condoms actually contain harmful chemicals that can foster disease. These Sustain condoms are made without any harmful chemicals, designed with all natural materials and lubrication. The manufacturer also donates a portion of profits to women's health initiatives. For anyone truly concerned about their health and the health of their partner it is a good idea to choose natural condoms like these. You will probably find that these are just as comfortable if not more comfortable than the mainstream brands, and the extra cost is worth it since you are less likely to experience any irritation or allergic reaction to these relative to the ones that have synthetic chemicals.\n"", u'\n  For a product that is touted as sustainable, there sure is a lot of wasteful packaging. There is a slide out box, inside of the outer box, and each condom is in its own wrapper, of course. A mix of paper and plastic, making recycling not as simple.', u""We tried the ultra thin and were disappointed. It didn't look as thin as other brands I use, and it certainly did not feel it. I lost a lot of sensation while using it, to a point where I got frustrated and took it off. It left my skin dry. My partner also complained that it dried her up (and she never has this problem)."", u""The company sounds like they have good social intentions.

It was a pleasant surprise how good these are compared with the cost. These came with bulk package without the original boxes, but quality seems to be fine as each individual packing is marked manufactured in Japan, so it is probably better than some other brand that is moved to China or Thailand for manufacturing. I have tried Okamoto Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's and Okamoto Latex 0.03's.  The 0.01 is the best at a cost of $3.5 each and I truly can't feel the condom when it is on. I almost just about cannot feel the existence of the 0.02 and 0.03 either, both at about $1.5 each. These Kimono at about $0.40 a piece and feels almost as good as the Okamoto 0.03 with all the condoms I tried so far. Many people feel Kimono is on the small side, and that is really nothing we can do about it, but I am average size and feel it is good enough, specially the thinness make you almost forget it is on anyway. But the Aqua Lube does feel different to other general lubes although it is not bad."", u""For the Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's, now these are really really thin and small and very difficult to put it on, because they lack the stretch-ability of latex, so don't think Kimono Micro Thin is difficult to put it on. Even at that, once Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's are on and warmed up, they feel great, really like nothing is there. Based on what I know, Kimono Micro Thin Aqua Lube is 0.044 mm thick, Okamoto 0.03 is acutally 0.038, and the Polyurethane 0.01 is 0.018 thick and 002 is 0.028 thick, all in mm. Sagami have similar product like Okamoto but they are all similar in price and thickness, so I assume they feel similar. Chinese Aoni has a 0.01 Latex material condom that is actually 0.036mm in thickness at about $1.50 a piece on Amazon that I haven't tried. So overall, I feel these Kimono are good enough and have the best value out there.\n"", u""\n  My Japanese girlfriend gave me one of these after mine broke...suffice to say that she provided the condoms thereafter.

My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to ""bare back"" sex than any other condom and I don\'t have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI\'s afterward.

Terrible purchase.\n', u""\n  This would be a really great deal if they weren't 2 years out of date.I recieved this packageon Tuesday October 12,2010 and they had an expiration date of September of 2008.\n"", u'\n  Just received that ""100"" pack, and it\'s just a bunch of loose condoms in a bubble envelope.  It\'s sketchy, and I\'m not even sure I\'d trust using them.  It says nowhere in the description that it won\'t come in factory sealed boxes, so I\'ll probably end up throwing them in the garbage.  Not worth risking an STD or pregnancy over $12.\n', u'\n  This is my favorite condom on the market.  It is very sensational and has a comfortable feel.  My old favorite was Trojan Magnum, but I found it to lessen the sensation.  Ever since I tried the Durex extra-sensitive I will never go back because of how soft and silky they are.  Durex extra sensitive gives you the ability to feel and protect your partner and you.  I trust Durex for pleasure and protection.\n', u'\n  Seller just put 100 items into a bubble envelope.

If we go without a jimmy hat I'll just shoot those little soilders into the sheets.  Crisis  diverted.\n"", u'\n  I have used hundreds of these, and never once have they produced a pregnancy. If the love well dries up, they can always be used as balloons at birthday parties.', u'One size fits all, so long as you are not too big and not too small.\n', u'\n  ', u'Durex extra sensitive condoms are undoubtedly one of the most popular condoms in the World. There is no way one can go wrong with these condoms. They have been credited as being super thin which enhances balminess while at the same time performing their duty of protection.  Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.', u'Sex is a pleasurable moment and when a condom insinuates otherwise then there is a problem. Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.', u'With such an impressive track record and good reputation, Durex extra sensitive condoms are one of the safest condoms out there. Any company that takes Research and Development into account is not only in the business for money. It actually means that they strive for excellence and distinction in providing its customers with the best of the best.', u'Read more \u203a', u'\n']","[u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'3.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009AHF1S,6 x 4 x 4 inches,,

Tingly. I am pretty big... not huge but 50 percent of condoms I try break yet this has never broken. They feel pretty nice.... I hate condoms yet these are purfectly accetable. The main downfall is they don't have a lot of lube. Just be prepared with some lube on the side.\n"", u'\n  These Trojan Fire & Ice condoms definitely live up to their reputation in terms of the tingling sensation promised.  As a man, it\'s actually quite pleasurable and does seem to lead to a more intense climax.  Unfortunately I feel that something isn\'t quite right with the fit of the condom itself.  I would describe these condoms as feeling ""baggy"", and the ring at the base does not fit as snugly as most condoms.  This gave a feel that the condom was constantly slipping during sex.  I have never experienced this issue with other condoms, and I\'ve tried many different brands, including other Trojans.  I would say I am average (or slightly above) in size, and usually condoms tend to feel slightly snug.  This is the first condom I\'ve used that felt loose.  I don\'t know if this is intentional due to the special lubrication, but it was worrisome during sex.', u""For my partner, she didn't especially enjoy using these condoms.  I don't think the sensation was that strong for her, and she even commented that the smell of the condoms was somewhat off-putting (i.e., the latex smell)."", u""Overall I do enjoy using these condoms, but I don't plan to purchase them again.  If I am looking for a similar sensation, I will use another brand of condoms in conjunction with a separate stimulating product.\n"", u'\n  Don\'t let the ""Fire and Ice"" label on the box question the quality of the condoms. I was afraid that this was going to have an ""ICY HOT"" effect, but it didn\'t. Truthfully, I thought these condoms held more heat than other Trojan brands. It also didn\'t feel or smell ""rubbery"" either. I would recommend this product to other people.\n', u""\n  These are by far my favorite condoms and I've pretty much tried them all. The lubricant gives a nice sensation for me, my boyfriend doesn't notice anything, but I don't thing its meant for him, more for the partner its used on. So I would give these a go for sure, and we've also never had any problems with them breaking or any other mishaps so they're great.\n"", u""\n  I went back to using condoms post-divorce.  These are the most amazing out of all the ones I tried on the market.  These will rock your world and provide amazing stimulation.

Tried Crown and Trojan Bareskin brands right before this. Wow, there is noticeable difference in thickness. I thought Crown thickness was nice but too tight. Aoni feels even thinner than Crown but actually stretches to a perfect form-fitting feeling, as they say, ""snug"", as if it was made just for my penis shape. The only gripe I have is the lubricant is too fragrant, although very nice to smell, like an apple or honeysuckle, but it\'s too distracting. But I do like the amount of lubricant, very nice, enough to cover the entire surface of the rolled out condom. I think I found my new favorite condom brand!\n', u'\n  I received this balloon animal making kit. I found the wide opening at the base of the balloons difficult to blow them up and hold air. Also  they have a very slick texture and the balloon kept sliding in and out of my hands and mouth I could not get  a good grip on them until finally the big moment came. I was able to get the first few twists in but then they cam undone so I ended up making a balloon sword instead but it looked more like a giant man part instead for some reason. Oh well maybe I should not try this by myself and get my husband to help me later with testing this product.', u'just kidding', u'he had a little bit of a difficult time rolling this on it would not unroll as easy as others we tried.', u'TAB A', u'SLOT B', u'REPEAT', u' they work', u""..... a little dry we added lube worked as condoms should. I'm not pregnant. My only quarry is with this condom and all others his helmet has a ridge that sticks up that I rather like and the tube shape of most condoms flattens that. So though these feel very natural skin to skin almost it does not allow for his shape to be his shape but we knew that going in. Maybe a suggestion for future products The helmeted hero design :-)"", u'I received these for s discount in exchange for my blatantly honest and now slightly embarrassed opinion.\n', u""\n  I'm not getting any younger, and need something with a bit more sensitivity than my usual Trojan Magnum XL.  Unfortunately these are much smaller than Magnum XL, despite the XL designation, and so are almost impossible to put on in the normal way.  Alternative is to partially unroll over two fingers from each hand, and then stretch it out and put on, slip out fingers, and unroll the rest."", u'The sensitive is pretty good - noticeable improvement over Magnum Bareskin and big improvement over Magnum XL.', u'The lube is also great - very thin and long lasting.  One partner liked the taste, the but another thought it numbed her tongue.', u""I will probably continue to carry both these and Magnum Bareskin in my kit, and use the Bareskin when there isn't time to fuss over putting it on, and Aoni XL when things are more leisurely.\n"", u""\n  Bought these and they're hard to get on and too small though they're labeled large. I'm a above average guy but not gargantuan. To make matters worse, in addition to being tight, these broke on the first use. Breakage happens sometimes so I didn't totally discount them but out of four, two of these broke. Threw the rest out as they're not worth the risk and worry. Definitely won't buy again. If you're above average in length and/or girth try the sagami large 002; I've used these awhile and they're pretty good especially if you put a drop or two of lubricant inside.\n"", u""\n   They feel better than other condoms during sex, definitely thin. Kinda hard to unroll on because they are so thin and it gets caught in itself while unrolling it down, if you know what I mean. I am 8 inches long and 5.8 inches circumference. I emailed the company and they said they were 54mm wide. I dont know about that because Trojan Magnums are 54mm wide, and these were not the same size as a Magnum for sure. They weren't an uncomfortable fit but they could release and XXL size and they may be perfect. But I am a fan and these will be my go-to condoms from now on. Interchanging with a Trojan Magnum every so often, but the Aoni will be #1 because I prefer the feeling lol.\n"", u'\n  great product hard to put on like most of the views say but once on its good to go.. I thought i was gonna get a really greater feel', u'out of them but it was ok just a lil better the the store products. but once you use these thin condoms the others are average. they are pretty strong havent had a breakage yet knock on wood lol...will buy another box just wish they made a XXL size.\n', u'\n  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased 100% honest review.', u""I received this item recently and have honestly found it to be a good product.

If your really shopping around for a good large condom, look at getting the ""TheyFit"" condoms out of the UK.\n', u""\n  My husband and I never use condoms since it's hard to find a condom that fits him comfortable in length and girth. Even with Trojan Magnums he would complain his penis felt like it was in a vise grip and well sex wasn't really good whenever he wore one. My husband works in a hospital and after an accidental needle stick condoms became a necessity until he was done with the precautionary 6 months of bloodwork."", u""I did my research and found One The Legend condoms. I checked out the reviews here on amazon and figured for the price they were worth a shot.  I'm glad I took a chance because these are the only condoms that have worked for us. My husband found them to be comfortable and he said there was enough room in the base and the head of the condom (which was his biggest complaint about other brands). They fit well, worked well and didn't cause a single issue in our sex life. They served their purpose for the 6 months they were needed and if they are ever needed again, this is definitely the brand I would continue to buy.

I purchased these because there are nights when a condom is necessary. With that being said I would have to say that these are decent for the price. These condoms are not super thick and allow you to still have some feeling unlike other brands I have used in the past. My only complaint with these is that there could be a little more lubrication in the package. I feel that the lube is sparingly in these and after you put the condom on, the lube almost disappears. For the price and the amount that you get, I cannot complain. My wife and I use these on certain occasions and so far have not had any break so that is a plus.

I've tried every variety of Trojan Magnum and have some expertise with this brand.

Meaning, what size the actual prophylactic is...may not be reflected in the hype or claims.  This is a longer than average but still average girth condom.  Length, stretched out with nothing in it is 8.75 inches by my primitive wooden ruler measure. Nominal, flat width is 2 inches across. Barely. Circumference, which is the size around the entire thing using the base ring cut off then snipped to measure is 4.5 inches.', u'This is fine for average, as average circumference supposedly ranges from 4.2 to 5.1"" however because this is a decent amount of stretch...that means if you are larger than 4.5"" around that it will start to bite into you slowly but surely.

I have tried Trojan Magnums and Magnum Ecstasy (I also tried regular size first but they were too small, so I won't review them).  The Ecstasy ones were just awful.  Worst sex I've ever had in my life.  You can read that review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RIA1GHP046SA9 .  The regular Magnums fit fine and were ok, but still too thick for me to get enough sensation to climax.  I was worried that my sex life was ruined.  Then I tried these because I read good things about them.  LIFE SAVED!  Sex with these on feels MUCH better than with latex.  It feels almost exactly like going bareback. I was able to climax just as easily as with no condom, and my wife said they felt good too.  They are also really strong and stretchable. I opened one up just to see how strong they are and it was pretty hard to tear.  It mostly just stretched to whatever size I stretched it.  I had to put my fingernails into it to get it to finally tear, so I'm confident these things will be reliable and I don't have to worry with them.  I don't see how they could possibly tear from sex.  I highly recommend you try these, even if you're happy with your current brand.  Polyisoprene is the best!  Latex is yesterday's news, IMO.\n"", u""\n  Almost every other 'large' condom has been painfully tight at the base. Those that weren't, were instead so thick that they were greatly desensitizing. Some terrible few even boasted both flaws. Previously, the one exception was the Trojan Naturalamb, but that smelled like what it was."", u""So, my partner and I ultimately gave up on condoms and used a combination of withdrawal and rhythm method to ensure that I pulled out whenever she was fertile. Worked for 10 years at a rate of 4-9 times a month. But lately, her cycle has become less reliable due to job stress, my awareness of ejaculation less consistent, and our willingness to forego the experience of sharing an orgasm less steadfast, so we've opted to return to condoms, in hope that 10 years of nanoscale science have seen some improvements in their design."", u'Sure have.', u""These things blow away all the other Trojan, Durex, and LifeStyles products I've tried. They're a bit long for me and end up bunching up at the base, but at last a condom both wide enough to be comfortable and thin enough to let me feel most of what I would feel without it. They're a tad desensitizing, of course, but only a bit more than the famously non-desensitizing Naturalamb, and only on the lower half of penis, which doesn't house many pleasure receptors to begin with. The upper 3 to 4 inches feel not only bare, but sometimes better than bare--whether because of the stark contrast with the slightly desensitized base or because of some 'pouching' happening at the head, I don't know, but it's fantastic.\n"", u'\n  This really is a large condom and not simply labeled ""large"" to make the buyer feel better. These are roughly the same size as a Trojan Magnum.', u'If I could give this 50 stars, I would. My girlfriend is severely allergic to latex, and until this came out our only option was those awful female condoms.\n', u""\n  I'm going to be real with you, these condoms will fit any guy with a girth above 4.75, so they're not as large as they say, but then again, they can stretch to fit someone with a girth of 6 as well (although very tight) without any breakage. My consensus is that if you're girth is from 4.75-5.75 these condoms will fit very comfortably without loss in sensitivity, if you're under 4.75 they'll be a little baggy and if you're over 6 they'll be pretty darn tight.\n"", u""\n  I'm one of those guys who is long and thick enough that most condoms are so tight, especially at the base, that I can't climax with a partner. Believe me, I was incredibly frustrated!"", u""I bought these after doing a search for large-size thin condoms. I hadn't heard about them, but I was going to try anything."", u""Well, they're great."", u'Now, I have the prolonged sensitivity to the warmth and tight feel of a partner so I can cum again! Also, my partners enjoy it, because they can feel my heat and the involuntary twitches and throbs they find exciting.', u'This was truly a life-changing product for me. Get some, you deserve it!\n', u""\n  I can't stand the feel of a condom but these are really not all that bad. I didn't need the large size for length just for the extra girth. I've bought these a few times now  but I can't find them anywhere cheaper. So sense I have to use a condom these are my first choice at least  till I find a monogamous partner. I get the majority of the feeling and they actually make me last a little longer so it's a win win for safe sex and prolonged intercourse. ++ for best price buy a few boxes for the Ad on deal well worth it. These cost 12 to15 bucks at the super center and drug stores.\n"", u'\n  I recently developed a latex allergy and went searching for something that would not irritate me. I found these. They truly are closest to wearing nothing for both him and her. I highly recommend them.\n', u""\n  They fit perfectly for me, but make sure you are using a sizing chart to find the right size for you. As far as the condoms themselves, I can't initially tell much of a difference between these and latex condoms such as magnums, but once I get going, it does seem like the condom starts to melt away and it feels much more natural. Definitely prefer these to magnums.\n""]","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004TTXA3W,1.4 x 3.1 x 5.4 inches,,

Highly recommend giving these a shot.\n"", u'\n  ', u""These have been my go to condoms ever since I first tried one.  My partner cannot use birth control and condoms have been our primary form of birth control.  We have never had any accidents or incidents.  We have tried the Naturalamb (our favorite, but expensive),  The Supra (Nice condom, it just didn't work for us, didn't feel right, fit right) and the regular Magnums (horrendous compared to premium alternatives). In addition we have sampled many non-Trojan brands (which we found to mostly be a waste of time as Trojan provides an extensive line of exceptional products. We have used literally hundreds of these, so I feel fairly confident in offering this detailed and subjective review."", u'First off this is the most comfortable latex condom I\'ve ever worn. Period. For informational purposes my penis is 7in length x 6.5in circumference. This fits me skin tight and having a snug form fitting condom is essential for the ""barely there"" sensation.  I cannot stress this enough, fitment is key regardless of the condom brand, type or gimmick.', u""These fit very snug at the base (some men don't like that). However, I do like that because it means we can get crazy and wild and not worry about the condom pulling off.  I hate checking the condom every five seconds to make sure it's still on, it destroys the intimacy.  I have never had this condom slip off, even when I'm not at peak performance. I've grown to trust it and sex has become a much more worry free, and intimate, activity.  If the snugness is your only issue I recommend a couple of practice runs without the pressure of pleasuring your partner.  When I first started using these they would smother my erection. I had to get used to the tight fit and I'm so glad I did."", u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u'\n  I never thought I was review a condom...my what an adventurous day this is!', u'I always knew these things were supposed to be miserable...as evidenced by the various surprise babies and, um, unhappy neither regions some folks encounter after festivities have concluded.', u""Well, it turns out these things aren't always miserable, they're just, er, incorrectly sized."", u'I was surprised when, after donning one of these, I felt comfortable...well, as comfortable as one can be when dressed in this fashion.  It no longer felt like I was trying to fit a cucumber into a thimble.', u""I'd prefer to go free range, however if one must muzzle the beast, and standard condoms feel a little too, shall we say claustrophobic, you might want to give these a try."", u""Alas, I will not be posting photos...I wouldn't want to overload their poor servers."", u""Highly Recommend...especially if you're too broke to support kids!\n"", u'\n  I find that this ""Ecstasy"" model is almost always sold out in drugstores, and if it\'s not, the price is $11-12. As usual, Amazon has the best deals. The extra bit of headroom is more comfortable for him, and they are so thin that we barely notice it\'s there. Never a leak or a break in 5 years of using this model. Highly recommended & worth the extra buck or two.\n', u""\n  These are just wonderful, for years I had no idea that I was using the wrong size condoms - i just assumed that's what it should feel like - she introduced me to these one night, and I never went back. give them a try. Girlfriend loves them as well - which is of course who we aim to please.\n"", u""\n  Been married seven years and just tried Magnums for the first time, boy was my husband happy I picked these up for him!  I can't say I noticed much difference, perhaps a little but my husband said they felt way better, it didn't strangle his 'junk'.  Amazingly he had never tried Magnums b/c he thought they were only for the long 'trouser snake' and his was running about average (51/2-6in), in length that is.  He's definitely above avg. in girth from my experience and would always mention how tight other condoms were, especially at the base.  I think these changed the whole experience of sex for him, and he can now boast that he needs Magnums! lol I don't think he'll go back to regular sized condoms ever again...mostly b/c I'm the one that buys them! I can't believe he's nearly 40 and never tried them!\n"", u""\n  I know I don't want to sound like a commercial, but you can barely feel like it's there.  I love these and I absolutely hate condoms.  So glad these exist.  Now I can be protected and still feel good too.\n"", u'\n  Love it! My husband and I sampled it once, really without me knowing, and afterwards I asked him if that was the same kind he had always been using, he said No. Then I told him whatever it was that he needed to keep it. I thought he was joking when he said Ecstasy. Well, the next time we used a condom, of course my husband had NOT taken my advice and instead used the ""same ole, same ole"" he was used to buying and, well, ""it"" felt like the ""same ole, same ole.""

Old stock is difficult, if not impossible to find, and delivery from Amazon dealers has yielded only the newer variety. While they claim that the condoms are the same, it is very clear that they are not. The Thai version is visibly more opaque and looks thicker (though the company swears that they are actually thinner now). More importantly they feel much thicker, and smell just a little bit more of latex. While the old Japanese version was incredible and a joy to use, the new Thai condoms feel very much like the desensitizing thick hunks of rubber you'll find in a truck stock rest room, only to be used as a last depressing and disappointing resort. Basically, any reviews before 2010 are probably of the old stock condoms, and are thus out of date. Extra points do go to these condoms for being very cheap as they are on par with anything you'll find at a grocery store-- but no better. It pains me to say it, but please don't buy these condoms until they return to their previous standards of greatness.\n"", u'\n  So there is not to much to say about a condom but I am giving it a go. Let me first start by saying that I have used a couple so far and non have broken yet. YAY! BUT, They do have a horrible smell once you open them. (yes I know they are rubber) But most condoms do not have weird rubbery generic rubbery smells. Next, they seem to leave me feeling ""dry"" They require A LOT of lube or they give me a burning feeling. (it does go away after a few hours) My husband says rubber burn. HAHAHA. Overall I can not complain to much since they are doing there job and not breaking while being used but I have definitely used ones that have felt and smelled much better, I probably will not buy these again and I would not recommend them. After all, most of us are using them for enjoyment so buy some that you will enjoy!!\n', u'\n  I\'ve tried a lot of other ""thin"" condoms that promises that they are the ""closest thing to nothing at all"" and this is by far the best condom in the market.

Although is not like not using nothing at all, it\'s very very close to it.\n', u'\n  A friend recommended these to me, so my girlfriend and I decided to try them out. According to her, they feel A LOT thinner than even the Ultra Thin Trojan condoms. While I have had many trojan condoms break, these Crown condoms have never broken on me yet. This, and the fact that they are less than half the price per condom of Trojans, makes them my new condom of choice. The condoms I received came in blue plastic sleeves, instead of the foil sleeve pictured, and I definitely prefer the plastic sleeves. They are far more durable than the foil ones, and are easier to slide into my wallet or bag.\n', u""\n  Super thin, but super durable. I've used plenty of other condom brands, but this is by far my favorite. Infact, the only condom I can actually say I like!"", u'The only downfall to these condoms is that they really are lightly lubricated. I would recommend using some lubricant with these condoms.\n', u""\n  Very good condoms, it seems like these condoms are little bit tighter than your regular condoms. Even though these condoms are advertised as regular condoms, they are definitely tighter than regular condoms. If you have average girth then don't worry too much, these will be great. These will be great if you have girth of 4.6 - 4.8 - which is basically average girth size range.\n"", u""\n  I've never had a condom break on me until I tried this one.

Obviously you should NEVER reuse a condom for prevention of pregnancy or disease transmission, but it's been a boon to be able to use each condom 1-5 times as a toy cover.

They are thick and rubbery and leave him feeling almost no sensation. Neither of us liked them, and we threw out the rest of the bag. We then went back to using Lifestyles Ultra Thins, which we had used before finding PP's, and they were okay - definitely the best for us out of the usual drugstore types that we'd tried, but we weren't in love with them. So, when we went shopping one day and saw these, we picked some up to try. We have a new favorite! As soon as I was putting it on him, I could tell that it felt way better, thinner, than other condoms, and he said that it almost felt as if he was bare the whole time. We can't compare side by side, but they are at least as good as our old PP ones, and probably better.

According to my partner, condomless sex= 10/10, male condom sex= 3/10, and female condom sex=7/10. So he liked them when we tried them. ON THE OTHER HAND, I could not stop laughing over how awkward it felt wearing one. It really was like a little ziploc bag hanging between my legs. Very much a 'just get over here and don't look at me'. They don't come packaged with enough lube, but you can just add more and I like that they're nitrile so I can use coconut oil. A lot of synth oils bother me but the lube on these didn't. It is a tiny bit difficult to get it to stay in and not twist around, but inserting it is easy and keeping track of it is just a necessity. Would I use them all the time? No. But do I prefer them to male condoms? Yes. However, whoever says putting them in can be sexy or you can put them in 20 minutes before having sex is full of it, haha. Unless you enjoy the baggie look.\n"", u""\n  We tried these because condoms are too small on my partner, but this felt like a garabage bag was between us. I am a petite woman. 5' at 105 pounds.  I found the inner ring to be way too large in diameter.  During intercourse there seemed to be too much latex even though my partner is well endowed.  This had so many positive reviews I was excited, but I can't use them as they make for uncomfortable sex.  I could see it working for me if they made a small size.\n"", u'\n  Product arrived on time and as described. If your new to this I suggest buying a high quality natural lubricant and practicing. Insertion is similar to that of nuvaring. If your using this as your only method of contraception I suggest using spermacide in addition to the fc2. I use this in conjunction with the mirena iud for sti protection and am very happy with this alternative. My partner and I have an open relationship and as you all know (or I hope) you must use condoms or female condoms to prevent potential infections-- which cannot be provided by birth control alone.\n', u""\n  Hard to be discrete about this product review.  Fits securely but neither partner feels it too much.  Much more comfortable for both partners than a male condom and no lub needed.  Male condoms feel like being serenaded by a saran-wrapped pickle and the man feels like a saran-wrapped pickle after all for that matter.  This way liberates both.  No more pickles, hello pleasure.  Can't recommend highly enough."", u'More pricey, but worth it.\n', u'\n  I was baffled by the design but willing to try these.

We both find we are  satisfied 100%\n', u""\n  I consider this one of the weirdest things I've ever tried.. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get it to go back very far and there was a lot of extra material hanging out. When I felt the inside of it, the inner ring was just sort of sitting there and I assumed a guy would be able to feel it since it's a pretty big ring and made of a harder plastic. Maybe I was doing it wrong, or it's not for petite women? I'll be sticking to the regular condoms. :)\n"", u'\n  Tried them for the first time and both of us were pleased with the comfort of these female condoms. The first insertion of the condom is a bit awkward, and the part that remains outside is a bit strange. The sensation is very different than with male condoms, however. His is increased and friction is non-existent for her. Might be difficult to use for quickies unless she is warmed up prior to putting the condom inside the vagina.', u'With regular use, this product will become much less awkward for us.

These \u201clarge\u201d condoms are very noticeably smaller than Trojan Magnums, or even Trojan Ultra Pleasure, in length and, more importantly, in girth.  (See the attached pic.)  This may be a bug or a feature for the obvious reasons.  The base doesn\u2019t taper quite so much as the Magnum either.', u'The condoms, though, are blessedly not so gunk covered as most condoms.  The feel, etc. is good once you get the condom on, which can be a bit of a hassle since: (1) it is curiously difficult to determine whether they are pointed in the right direction, and (2) it is also curiously difficult to keep air out of the tip.', u'Disclosure: I received a complimentary box of condoms from the seller.\n', u'\n  ', u""There aren't a lot of options for larger condoms. What is out there, well I'm not a huge fan of the names. Magnum - that's a 357 that Clint Eastwood used to shoot people, not something I like to imagine when I'm covering up me and putting it in somebody that I love, or want to love. Magnum, a great big bottle of Champagne, well that's closer to something I might consider. Trojan - wasn't that a horse where soldiers hid and once they were inside, they got out and pillaged the castle? Sounds kind of leaky."", u""L - now that's a pretty wonderful name. Phonetically it is the French word for her - Elle. I like that, this is going to cover something up that will go inside her - well it could go inside him - Lui, not far off L."", u""Large - how simple does that get? No need to wonder, it is large, not jumbo or XL. And there's no need to flaunt the size - L puts the size in small letters just below their logo - L. Yeah Magnums kind of advertise that you are using something bigger."", u""Do you need large? Get out your ruler. There's no need to do that silly flexible tape measure, string thing. Just grab any old ruler, get hard, put the ruler underneath and look at how wide you are. If you're much over 2 inches wide, quarter inch is wider - then use large. If you're 2 inches or less, then use the regular size. Don't worry about length for condoms, that doesn't matter at all."", u""This isn't about size matters and feeling more manly buying a bigger condom, this is about getting something that fits right. Comfort for you. If the condom rolls on easily and doesn't squeeze you tightly, you'll wear one and it will feel good. If you are too small, the condom could slip off. Here's the problem with that - it will probably slip off someplace where it is very hard to get back."", u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  I was privileged enough to receive samples from L. for the Large, Classic and Ultra Thin.  All of which are great products, and just serve a different purpose. I must say after testing all of them my favorite by far are the Ultra Thin as it's true it really feels like nothing is there. I would compare these Large with the Magnum's from Trojan. However I like the feel better of these from L. for one all of Trojan's seem to be over lubricated and that is never good, as well as the scent/taste I've been told are horrible on the Trojan's. Whereas with L.'s condoms you have no taste at all and no scent so nothing but greatness in those departments."", u""Then if you take the time to check out their website or read the back of the boxes. You will see the Philanthropic work that L. does and it's absolutely amazing. For every condom sold they give a condom to someone in a country that has horrible outbreaks of AID's. Doing this helps control the situation and they also teach safe sex and the importance of using a contraceptive in these foreign countries. So not only are you getting a quality product but you know you are helping make a difference in the world one condom at a time."", u'I did receive these condoms at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.\n', u""\n  On my husband's account. I bought these for us to try a non toxic version of condoms but the the large size is misleading. These were very tight at the base to the point we couldn't use it. If you are truly large and can only use large sized condoms then do not buy these. For reference we use Skyn Condoms in Large.\n"", u""\n  The philanthropic goals of the company are very respectable. Controlling birth rates helps out developing countries immensely and lowers poverty rates. The large version gives adequate room for actions without the fear of breaking or lessened pleasure from discomfort. The packaging of individual condoms is also very strong so low fear of puncture when storing. Only reason why I cannot give it five stars is because when I received my package the main box the condoms came in was damaged and open. The condom roll was loose in package. Not exactly sure what happened, but for paying premium I don't think there the box should have come opened. An open box of condoms is particularly concerning since I don't know whether or not it has been tampered with or it was just damaged in shipping. Very risky knowing the consequences...I inspected it nothing is visible wrong under light, and we're being vigilant. Otherwise good experiences all around.\n"", u""\n  I don't usually write Amazon reviews and I most certainly do not review products I'd rather keep secret but this one HAD to be the exception."", u'First of all, the packaging on this product is awesome. It is sleek, and elegant and honestly much more discrete than most other condom boxes and wrappers.', u'The actual condoms themselves are a good fit, high quality and non smelling product. In other words they hit the nail on the head (oops, that has a double meaning...maybe an appropriate one here).', u'All this given the fact that they also donate condoms to those in needs! I must say, that is truly nice to hear. And best of all they are reasonably priced!\n']","[u'3.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GR84C9E,1.6 ounces ( ),1.6,

Thin and extremetly sensitive, I can't imagine going back to any other brand.  The only drawback was the price, however, the price offered for bulk purchases on Amazon was a true bargain!!!\n"", u'\n  I swear by Crown, Beyond Seven, and Kimono condoms. While restocking, I found a great deal here on Amazon. The picture shows ""Made in Japan,"" as they always were but my batch were made in Thailand. had I known these condoms were of lower grade, I would have gone with Kimono condoms. There is a distinct difference between the Thailand vs Japan versions. I\'ve learned the same of Crown, so buyer beware.\n', u'\n  If you\'re bigger than average, these will help out. I\'m super nervous about impregnating someone and having a condom that actually covers me completely is a ""huge"" bonus. They feel pretty good, too. I still suggest adding some water based lube, though. You don\'t want these to tear, not that any of them have, but again, I\'m reaaaally nervous about that.\n', u'\n  The condom itself is blue, which is not a problem for us, but I know some prefer the skin colored condoms. They are truly just lightly lubricated, but I prefer that so they aren\'t so messy when you put them on. Sensation is about what you\'d expect, there are definitely thicker ones out there, but there are thinner ones too. We have used about 10 of these so far and all of them have passed the ""water test"" afterwards. Really for the price and quantity it\'s hard to beat them as they\'re comfortable and my wife likes them. Crown is the only other that I\'d put with this as far as being a good condom for a great price. I wish I would have known about these sooner as it would have saved us a lot of money.\n', u""\n  It's the same as the Crown's that I reviewed. They are good condoms with lubricant. I haven't had any problem with it. Just a notice that if you are a big and tall guy, these may not fit you well.\n"", u'\n  These were thin, sensitive and strong and were not overly lubricated; most condoms we tried had too much lubrication despite the ""lightly lubricated"" claims. Hopefully there will be an unlubricated version for a slightly lower price so the user can try his/her own lubricant.\n', u'\n  They sure are extra thin but quite durable. I am surprised because the Trojan condoms that are extra thin almost tear instantly when spicing things up. These here did better than the Trojans. Of course, I am not encouraging to go further off from finding out when it will break, just take it easy. So yes, I recommend these condoms.\n', u""\n  A well known, name brand condom, sensitive and durable, at the amazingly low bulk price of about 16 cents each.

Either way, typical latex condemns are not an option. Pregnancy prevention was my primary concern with my partner and first tried the Natural Lamb condoms due to mostly rave reviews on heat transfer, etc. In my experience they were ok, but they did have a slight odor that could be off-putting. The Bareskin non-latex have been a winner for me. They do fit a bit tight and can be a bit daunting to put on. I've went through a few trying to figure out which side is up, but figured out that if I slow down and pay attention to how it comes out of the package it isn't a problem. These have been the best feeling condoms I've worn in terms of heat transfer and how it feels. Of course nothing like no condom, but marked improvement over the latex ones I've tried and I though they felt better than the lamb skin ones.\n"", u'\n  What sick individual thought of this?', u'These should be called ""Trojan Supra Frustration""', u'Putting these on is like trying to stuff a school bus into a trash bag.

BULL$@@!, it\'s like going to a all you can eat seafood buffet with a sock on your tongue and a noose around your neck. These fu*king things fit tighter than Chris Christie wearing size 3 spandex after a afternoon at a all you can eat pizza buffet. It\'s like having a tourniquet slowly tightened around your junk while doing the \'ole in & out. First it hurts, then you go numb..now compound that with the sock comment earlier and you might just give up... First time ever I thought if just giving up, rolling over and going to bed. Meanwhile my wife has this strange look on her face, no it wasn\'t ecstasy, it was pain. She said it was like trying to have sex with a hot curling iron!!! What do they lube them with, pepper spray?

I would assume I'm average in the size and shape dept.  Wife and no others have ever complained.  The tightness only adds to the enjoyment especially during the blastoff stage for me, but I can see where other folks are coming from if they are perhaps a bit more gifted than I.\n"", u'\n  With a latex allergy I used these condoms in hope that I could try something new and have a brand to go back and forth to. However, these condoms hurt so bad we had to stop intercourse. It felt like it was burning rubber down there (& yes I was lubricated enought). I do not recommend these condoms to ANYONE with a latex allergy.\n', u""\n  These condoms are really difficult to put on. I'm just under 7inches. Took several minutes to put on.

These did smell a tiny bit, now I am thinking about it, and on an averaged sized guy, would likely work out well, if not great. Certainly good for those with latex allergies.

In short, it\'s a darn good product with terrific sensitivity, a bit better than the Trojan Ultrathin. It also fit a little tighter than other condoms, and, according to the female perspective, ""smells nice"". My positive review said that the condoms were premium products but wondered if it was worth the high price. I also thought that the people who would pay the premium price for the incremental sensitivity would be the playing crowd with frequently changing partners.', u'This leads me to the other half of the package. The Nanosilver is, even more so than the regular Ultrathin 001, solidly a product aimed at the customer segment with multiple partners. It is basically the same as the Ultrathin 001 in every aspect, except that it has ""nanosilver"" added. I believe the nanosilver is colloidal silver. Some reviewers commented that it was a spermicide. I don\'t believe that is the case. The silver is there to kill germs. Look up colloidal silver, and you can see that the purported function of the silver is its ability to disrupt the microbes and stop them from reproducing. I would imagine the risk of catching something is the number one concern for people who frequently change partners or get together with unknown partners. For that reason, I think it is worth price for those particular customers. For other customer segments, they will be well served by the regular Ultrathin 001.', u'I hope this review is helpful to your purchase decision (please give me a yes vote if you agree!)

While it true that you can still feel that there is something on your skin, the sensation is definitely maximized.  They come with lube already applied on both sides which is nice.  Honestly, getting used to them was hard, because of a couple of reasons.  First, off, because they are so thin, they are little more difficult to peel downwards.  It helps to use two hands.  Secondly, I kept thinking the condom was broken because it felt so close!  Overall, this is my new favorite condom.  They never broke on me, and I'm pretty girthy.

I myself read reviews of products before purchasing them and always try to get the best deal that I can, and I would never want my product review to mislead anyone else who might be doing the same buying research. If an item is bad, I will be up front and tell you. In this way, I am completely transparent with my reviews and will stand by them. By taking the time to mindfully test the product thoroughly, and by being completely honest in my reviews, you can count on them to lead you to good products and veer you away from bad ones. My family and friends are always asking me for advice on their buying decisions, and I always love to give my input. Thank you for reading my review!\n', u""\n  So, I've used several types of condoms, yet I've never used anything of this caliber. The condom goes on a bit tight, but the way it feels is amazing."", u'The regular ultra thin is awesome. It appears to be very strong and hold up very well through rigorous work. Even from pulling out exposing it to the air, it showed no signs of weakening or tearing. The ultra thin is a guinness book of world records setter (as all the condoms are.) I thought that was just a gimmick as I\'ve tried several ""ultra thin"" products. No my friends, this is in another league of it\'s own. The smell is actually quite nice. It is somewhat floral, yet I can\'t seem to figure out exactly what it is. I\'ve has terrible smells from very high name brand condoms which actually make the experience not as good. When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it\'s not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don\'t expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.', u'The Nanosilver this is basically the regular condom with what seems to be spermicide. It feels no different than the other to me, but maybe someone wants extra protection.', u'Overall, I had a very pleasant experience with these condoms. I think they are well made and feel great. They are a bit on the pricey side, yet I understand why they have such a premium. You get 24 condoms with this purchase. They come in a very high quality nice box. I love these condoms I think they are amazing.', u'I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.\n']","[u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WPW4DQI,4.8 ounces ( ),4.8,

I give it 3/5 only because it's fun to pretend that a mediocre review from some shmuck on Amazon will motivate the company to develop a condom (or alternative way of preventing pregnancy and STDs) that feels even remotely as good as unprotected sex feels. Get right on that, people.\n"", u""\n  I needed a contraceptive besides birth control pills for my boyfriend and I.

I decided to try the Extended Pleasures. Wow I think they worked a little too good, as I had trouble reaching climax.

And yes, the Benzociane certainly does numb you which makes it both good and bad.

I guess the best way I can describe it is if your tool had fallen asleep.  Kind of the numbing, tingling feeling you get when your foot falls asleep.  Very different.  I certainly cannot say I had any problem with them breaking.  I agree with the first review in that they seem even thicker than average condoms.', u""It's not an item that I would probably use again unless I had some trouble but it does do the job that it promises to do.\n"", u""\n  This particular type of condom has an ingredient called benzocane which REALLY numbs your genitals.  I found it REALLY difficult to climax after any amount of time.  With the extra long time it took, my partner became dry and it was uncomfortable.

If you want to have any idea what is going on then look else where. Could not tell if I was in or out, ""at attention"" or limp.\n', u'\n  This works as explained but BE CAREFUL.

The condom goes on a bit tight, but the way it feels is amazing."", u'The regular ultra thin is awesome. It appears to be very strong and hold up very well through rigorous work. Even from pulling out exposing it to the air, it showed no signs of weakening or tearing. The ultra thin is a guinness book of world records setter (as all the condoms are.) I thought that was just a gimmick as I\'ve tried several ""ultra thin"" products. No my friends, this is in another league of it\'s own. The smell is actually quite nice. It is somewhat floral, yet I can\'t seem to figure out exactly what it is. I\'ve has terrible smells from very high name brand condoms which actually make the experience not as good. When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it\'s not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don\'t expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.', u'The Nanosilver this is basically the regular condom with what seems to be spermicide. It feels no different than the other to me, but maybe someone wants extra protection.', u'Overall, I had a very pleasant experience with these condoms. I think they are well made and feel great. They are a bit on the pricey side, yet I understand why they have such a premium.', u'I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.\n', u""\n  Excellent quality ultra thin condoms. These are made for people who may use multiple partners because these condoms are made in a way that the condom helps to clean and sterilize secretions. This is a condom that has an almost sweet smell to them. Nothing like a cootie killin condom that smells like flowers. The condom held up well thru a variety of challenges. Since this is a PG review, no pics or videos were allowed. Overall, we are very pleased with the quality of these condoms. It's been a few years since we had to use a condom so this brought back memories.  My husband said that these condoms helped improve his sex life. He is now wanting to know when the next box is due to come in. We did receive these well made condoms at a reduced cost. We would recommend these because of the quality and the nanosilver infused technology that makes it a clean/safe condom which really can give you that worry free sex. Thanks!!\n"", u""\n  These are in the Guinness Book of World Records as the thinnest condoms known to mankind and they are indeed incredibly thin. However, it didn't seem to translate into more sensation and that crazy thinness has a couple downsides. Namely, they are really, really tight. In fact, trying to roll it all the way down was next to impossible, meaning it was about halfway on and kept getting in the way. Not comfortable. I do like the idea of bacteria-fighting agents on them, but it's hard to say whether that worked or not (I'm assuming it did). But I don't see enough difference between these and regular condoms to warrant paying the extra money for them."", u'Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n', u'\n  The product arrives in discrete packaging, even the main packaging doesn\'t scream ""condoms"" like some brands do. The individual packaging is easy to open. The lubricant is applied in an adequate quantity and has less of an odor compared to other brands. The latex is super thin and my husband reports it ""feels like it isn\'t there, almost alarmingly so"". I admit, we checked a few times to make sure it was still intact - but no problems with breakage. Can\'t necessarily speak to the ""efficacy"" of the nanosilver ""cleaning"" quality, but definitely no added irritation or anything noted.', u'Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n', u""\n  I love all of aoni's condoms. They are my husband's and my own favorite. They feel like half a condom. They are so thin that we were scared they would break. They do however hold up to some rough sex. We have never had one break. We have probably used around 30 condoms. We had a higher breakage rate with Trojan and Durex. The only problem with this particular condom is that it makes me, the female, feel and uncomfortable burning sensation. I thought it would go away but it lasted the entirety of the night. It did not hurt horribly but it was extremely uncomfortable and it made sex unenjoyable. Sadly I cannot recommend this condom. I do however think it is the spermicide. Perhaps I am allergic to this particular kind. I do recommend every other type of Aoni condoms."", u'My husband had no issue with this condom I think it was only the spermicide that maybe I allergic to.', u'We received this condom at a discount in order to test it and leave honest feedback for our fellow shoppers.\n', u'\n  These felt great and my gf noticed the difference in texture and smell.

I cannot comment on the length comparison of it being the longest on the market but i will say that it is a very long condom. its about a foot long maybe longer, and the diameter is larger too. if the regular durex condoms feel tight for you like they do for me then this is one worth trying. I ordered some to try out along with my usual bulk order of Durex condoms and will probably be ordering a large quantity of these when it comes time to restock my drawer. they are not studded or ribbed which is the only drawback to them, and they are a white/clear latex. the lubricant is the standard nonflavored durex lubricant, and they are not the thickest condom Durex makes but it is more than thick enough to withstand rigorous use.

My feet are Women 9 (US), and it was very easy to get one of these over a foot. I flexed, spread out my toes, and it was fine. If one of these condoms can fit over my foot and not break, it's very likely to fit over your business and hold up the same, if not better.

My husband has a wider girth that makes any condom width under 2"" uncomfortable. The Skyn Large is 2.1"" wide which he finds to be a much better fit. The length fits him well also(he is 8.5)', u""2. We tried these yesterday and they really ARE very thin! I could feel his particular shape and contours which is a plus because most condoms we've used make his penis feel like a shapeless dildo."", u""3. There is GREAT heat transfer, as described by many other reviewers. Afterwards, my husband asked me to make sure it was still 'on'(it was) so even more points for feeling real for him."", u'CON', u""1. His only real complaint was that he could not feel the 'wetness' that he's used to, but I think we will try the 2 drops of water-based lube on the inside of the condom next time to increase sensation for him."", u'***Update*** The waterbased lube trick was a success!', u'A++ for these condoms. I bought them at Walgreens for $16 bucks, mostly because I wanted to try them right away but next time I will buy from amazon for the better deal, especially when I can get free shipping.\n', u""\n  Not something I'd normally review.  Since I rely heavily on reviews for my purchases including this recent purchase I figured what the heck."", u'Everything all the people say about these condoms is true.  Also because they are made basically from high grade plastic there is no worry about what lubricant you use.  They fit well and are less snug than normal condom.', u""Oh one other thing.  Mine came in a zip lock bag so don't expect one of those cool boxes you usually get at the store, but who cares as long as the product is intact that is what maters.  That zip lock bag comes in a usual Amazon box that you can probably have your three year old drive over in his tricycle and still have no damage.  (However don't try this at home.)\n"", u""\n  Girl review here: So, I'm allergic to latex. I took it upon myself to get an IUD to not get pregnant until I wanted to get pregnant because of this with my ex boyfriend three years ago. Well, needless to say, we broke up a year after that. Meet this wonderful guy and he's everything I would want in a guy, besides a few things...but hey, I'm a girl, of course I am going to nit pick."", u'His only issue with us having sex...which of course we have all the time...is that he has herpes and I do not. I am not taking the risk either even though he has not had an outbreak in over five years. Sorry, medical professional here and I know the stats, which are in my favor, but nope, that is not going to happen.', u""Feels weird to be having 'protected' sex again, but like the other reviewer said, this product is awesome. It feels almost like its not there and it doesn't have the funky smell like some other brands."", u'Only brought it online because my store stopped carrying this brand since I guess I am the only one buying them.\n', u'\n  Staying safe is needed. This the only condom I use now. The non-latex is a winner for me, it keeps me in the game. Great feel,  no slip off. Plus now a days females has to stay away from latex do to allergic reaction of latex condom.\n', u'\n  There is a slightly tighter fit compared to the Trojan Magnum Bare Skin condoms.  It is great not having the latex smell but I prefer the Trojans since they feel thinner giving him and her more pleasure.\n', u'\n  Very comfortable, way better feel than Magnums or Magnum XL.  Maybe a bit larger than Magnums and smaller than Magnum XL.  Not as long as Durex XXL.  And no latex!\n', u""\n  They are a bit smaller than Trojan Magnums (large), but they also feel thinner. I've found that they can get too tight if I don't leave a bunch of extra room at the tip.\n"", u'\n  I keep buying from you guys because the price is great for a 24 count. I will definitely be a return customer!

I recieved exactly 100 condoms. It contained around 50 Durex, and rest in Kimono,Beyond Seven, Crown and some others. Its a real bargain and I recieved within 5 days.', u'Good job.\n', u'\n  Nice variety. All were undamaged and have no less than a 2 year expiration date from when i received them. There are some xl in the mix also. Not only a brand variety but style variety also. There were more brands than mentioned in the listing (One, Rough Rider, Seven and a few more I cant remember).  Even included a few single use lubes, a glow in the dark condom, some colored condoms, lubed, non-lubed, studded, ribbed, sensation enhancer, and even a couple extended performance condoms. Great overall variety and even a better price.  Fast shipping too.\n', u'\n  The good:', u""-Great value. About 20 cents per condom, so about as good as you'd get buying about 100 of a single type."", u'-Nice variety overall. For the most part you get six of each type, so definitely enough to give them a few tries before you decide that you hate or love them.', u'The meh:', u'-Got twelve of the durex performax intense, which my s.o. just happens to already dislike.', u'The ugly:', u'-Only received 94 condoms, not 100.', u'-No Trojans. Only one set of Okamoto.', u'-Eighteen of them expire in less than a year (advertised 2-5 years from order date)', u'-Six of those expire in two months....', u'Verdict:', u""I'll still get use out of most of these, but what I received did not meet my expectations.  Personally, I might buy here again, but not before trying another vendor.\n"", u""\n  First time purchasing from CondomMan. I must say I'm very impressed! Unrivaled prices, huge assortment of condom types and brands. Shipped to Canada via UPS and then Canada Post, took approximately 2 weeks as expected. Even with the conversion from US to CAN $, ~$0.30/condom is amazing bang for your buck. Number count is exact, expiry dates range form 2016 to 2019. Shipment is discrete in a small bubblewrap envelope, items marked as latex gloves."", u'The only negative so far would be that there were very few of the ""exotic"" condoms that\'s rare to find in stores, such as the Kimono\'s and Crown\'s. Also, no Trojan\'s in this shipment. But the number and brands of condoms likely vary greatly per order, so it\'s no biggie.', u'Overall, very pleased with my purchase. Great variety for those who want to try all sorts of condoms, and great value too! I will definitely buy from CondomMan again!', u'Here is a breakdown of what I received:', u'-Durex Pleasure (6)', u'-Durex Sensitive (4)', u'-Durex Sensations (9)', u'-Durex High Sensation (6)', u'-Durex Extra Sensitive (2)', u'-Durex Pleasure Max (6)', u'-Durex Love (6)', u'-Durex Apple (3)', u'-Durex Strawberry (3)', u'-Durex Banana (3)', u'-Lifestyle Colors (6)', u'-Lifestyle Ultra lube (4)', u'-Lifestyle Ultra thin (4)', u'-Lifestyle Ultra Sensitive (6)', u'-Lifestyle Tuxedo (4)', u'-Kimono Thin (8)', u'-Kimono Microthin (3)', u'-Kimono Aqualube (2)', u'-One (8)', u'-Crown (5)', u'-Beyond Seven Studded (2)', u'-Beyond Seven Aloe (2)\n', u'\n  I know this is a random selection, but it seems like I got a disproportionate amount of the colors and textures, and not very many of the standard condoms. I\'m interested to try ""extra lubricated"", but in my mind that\'s just probably extra-gross. Wish me luck!\n', u'\n  I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. Some of the condoms that came in this package seemed small and would break easily. Pretty soon we figured out which ones were the small ones and stopped using those. I think this is a great deal for the price and if you wanted to get them for a fraternity or a sorority it is a good idea. This could be bought for anyone that is trying to practice safe sex. Just beware that if your boyfriend is well hung not all of the condoms in the surprise variety pack are going to fit. I would recommend for other people to buy.\n', u'\n  Good selection and a good price. I counted to be sure and I got 100, just like they promised.

When you first take one out of the wrapper you immediately notice its not your normal condom, it does not roll on like one normally does and it doesnt smell like one.  When I say it doesnt roll on normal I mean I couldnt just grab the tip and roll back, I had to roll it back with both hands, I also dont think it has a bad smell, Lambskin condoms smell bad, I just think if youll been dealing with latex for awhile, this condom will take you by surprise.', u'I really enjoyed the feeling of this condom, it felt thinner then most(Trojen Ultrathin has been the best for me so far) and didnt get all wrinkled up and cut off my bloodflow like latex.  They come in a gold wrapper but there not porn star sized.  LOL  I would recommend this condom to anyone looking for something not latex for a change.\n', u""\n  After suspecting that I was allergic to latex, seeing that whenever me and my Fiance' used a regular condom it would burn and irritate me, we decided to try these. They are awesome! I guess I was allergic to latex, because these don't burn or irritate me at all. My Fiance' said that these have a better fit than any of the other condoms we've tried and they are thinner, and don't have a plastic-y feel like most thin condoms; these are really silky and soft. I could tell he was wearing a condom, but it was very slight, this is the least I have ever felt a condom. I've never felt a silkier condom, I usually feel all the wrinkles and creases in a regular condom, but not these, these actually FIT. And they are strong, they didn't break. For some crazy reason my local Publix was selling these for $5 for a box of 12, that's what prompted me to try them.\n"", u'\n  This is my first time purchase for this latex-free condom (great for latex allergies). I am very happy with it and so is my husband. Body heat seemed to be conducted a bit, so this is plus with a raincoat... I have just ordered more of them.

If you need the width of the xl, then this is the place to get them. They are the only condoms that do not bust on my husband, but dang they can be expensive so it was great to find this deal.\n"", u""\n  These have been my favorite since they started making them for us larger men. If your under 8 inches and have average girth then these are not for you. Next size down from the XL's are the regular magnums.\n"", u'\n  Magnum XL condoms carry the reliability of the Trojan brand name in an extra large size, in fact, 30% wider than regular condoms.', u'If regular condoms are just a little too constricting, I suggest getting the regular Magnums first. Trojan Magnum XL condoms specifically fit those with an erection circumference of 5.5"" or more (meaning about 10-15% of the market). If needed, they roll out to a full length of about 8"".', u'The first time I tried a Magnum XL, sex felt amazing. The base is tight for a secure fit but thanks to the tapered design, I still have all the blood flow I need to keep things going. The extra assurance from knowing that these condoms are individually electronically tested is an added benefit. The Magnum XL has been my condom of choice for years now.\n', u""\n  These condoms are the best because of the size more than anything. Most brands do not cater to the very well endowed man and this definitely takes care of that issue but... I found that they could be a bit unreliable. Over the time that I had them (I'm in a long term monogamous relationship)  they seemed to break 1 out 3 times. That's a lot! Not to mention the smell of the latex is none too appealing. I do like them though and overall I would recommend this product.\n"", u'\n  I have never had problems with Magnum condoms.  The regular Magnum condoms are too tight.  I love how the Magnum XL condoms fit.  They are quality condoms and do not slip off.  The quantity is great for the price as well.  If needed and to prevent tears, water based lubricants should be used with condoms.\n', u'\n  I have been using Trojan Magnum products for years but have always had problems with how tight they fit. The new tapered design is much better because now the only place they are tight on me is at the base where it rolls down. The best part is the reliability of the Trojan name - major Kudos from me!\n', u""\n  These are amazing.  If you've got problems with condoms being too narrow and doing too much constricting, these are probably going to be the solution for you, as they've greatly helped me.\n"", u'\n  The old man and I have not been together for a while and it is generally hard to find these sized condoms in stores when we need them, so I got him this ""100-pack"" for Christmas.

He didn't like it but put up with it so I could give fellatio longer and enjoy it more.  My husband has a slightly smaller than average penis and it fit him tightly so I'm sure they will fit an average penis too tightly and larger than average penis probably would not fit in this.  They were a little difficult to roll on but stayed on once there. Again: taste great!

They don\'t feel cheap and limp like a lot of other smaller brands, but neither are they thick and uncomfortable like some of the ""extra protection"" styles out there.

They have the perfect amount of lube on them, not so much to be messy but just enough ease the way. I prefer these over their classic ribbed just because they are not as intense but that is personal preference. This is the perfect way to ease yourself into the wild world of textured condoms.

I don\'t find them to be ""pleasurable."" Instead, they are pretty uncomfortable, making my ""manhood"" feel like it\'s on fire. Not something that excites me, but to each his own, right?

It\'s actually frustrating. The condoms claim to be ""XL"" but they don\'t seem to be XL. Maybe I don\'t understand how big XL is. All I know is, they are too small. Maybe I\'m some kind of mutant who isn\'t normal in size and shape but I don\'t understand the point of tapering down a condom from the head to the base. The head of the condoms will accomidate the 16.5 cm but the base will not. It cuts off the circulation like a rubber band. And not in a helpful, c0ck ring way, but in a harmful, feels like it\'s cutting in two, way. Very uncomfortable. Also too short but, again, maybe I\'m not normal. :)\n', u""\n  my husband and I love these condoms; they fit great and come in 'fancy' gold wrapping.  Trojan is the only brand I know that makes XL condoms so i don't think they have much competition! great product.\n"", u'\n  these are definately BETTER fitting than all of the other condoms and the ONLY ones that fit me and its perfect lengthwise but circumfrance its too tight and sufocating like a rubber band...... they ought to make tube sock sizes NOT 30 percent larger than something i cant even fit half way on\n', u""\n  These condoms are not bad, definitely workable, and the best we've found so far. The fit is good for a man with a penis that is too large for regular or large condoms and the latex is pretty thin. Sometimes they slide towards the head from the base of the penis but nothing severe. Overall I'm satisfied with the product.\n"", u""\n  Not only to prevent hiv spreading, I use these for oral sex. There are std's you can share non consensually if you have oral sex unprotected. The lube they put on it isn't disgusting, doesn't interfere with my good time. Condoms, one size does not fit all, it is important to have the right size so there isn't too much nor too little condom to work properly."", u'You must compare prices every time you shop in order to get the best buy and consider shipping costs.

So while they\'re not as nice as some of the newer, seriously thin ones (unlike every other Trojan model, their BareSkins are amazing!) I do find them pretty comfortable from my side of the fence, as it were.  Women vary in their reactions, presumably since the thickness from the ""outside"" feels differently to them (and obviously, I can\'t personally speak to that.)  Some seem to feel (and dislike) the thickness more than others, even with the softer/more flexible material.', u'On the plus side, I think this is the *only* brand/model that has never, ever broken under any circumstances in my (at this point in my life, rather long) experience.  Condom breakage is rare, and personally, I can\'t imagine ever not noticing it immediately (my immediate reaction is always a fraction-of-a-second moment of panic that something really horrible like a burst blood vessel has happened ""down there""! (lol)), but it is something to consider.  In that respect, these are a great compromise between sensitivity and sturdiness.  (""Heavy duty"" condoms are, in my experience, really, really awful in every way imaginable except perhaps their sturdiness.)\n', u""\n  I'm a bit of an internet shopping addict. All of the gadget deals and used oddities captivate my attention (and money) like few other things can. While that might sound like I don't like to go out into the real world, the truth couldn't be farther from that assumption. I often find myself the center of ladies' attention, and prefer to be safe about it. (As should you, obviously.)"", u""So what's this we have here, then? Condoms that can be bought bulk? Online? Perfect. I ordered a hundred of these guys and have been making progress through them. The last hundred I ordered (also from Amazon) performed admirably, so I thought I might as well just go with what I know."", u""The bad? I'm not sure that the lubricant on these is as high quality as other brands. Where it inevitably dries on sheets, skin, etc. it seems to leave behind a sort of latex powder residue which can be highly unnerving if you aren't prepared for it. Because let's be honest- if you're wearing a condom, the last thing you want is some sort of unpredictable thing to happen. These also don't have the most comfortable fit in the world. As in: take this off and you will probably notice that you weren't quite as big as you could possibly have been. The packaging is also exceptionally boring, and that's why I didn't give this five stars."", u""The good? They don't fall off. They work. Not cheaply made. Never broken one during all 120ish that I've used so far. They are dirt cheap in terms of price, so if you and your partner decide to take a short water break, you can get a fresh one and everything is awesome. Also shipped in a completely non-descript box, so roommates weren't crowing over it when it arrived.\n"", u""\n  No complaints on my end.  These condoms are sturdy, comfortable, and protective.  My husband loves them and they are generously lubricated.  Minimal dry out.  Can't beat the price for quantity either.\n"", u'\n  They arrived quickly and I was able to stock up. You might say you get more bang for your buck.\n', u""\n  Best condom ever used and I am glad they are so cheap on amazon. we have tried other brands but this is the best, most realistic feel! We have bought the 100 count a few times already. Out of the 300 condoms used, not one has broken yet for my husband and I. It's a good buy at a great price!\n"", u""\n  Kind of weird condoms...there was lube on the outside of the condom packages, the lube on the condom drys fast and leaves these white flakes on the condom and their pretty big and I'm not that little either, but overall they do their job...they haven't broke on me yet...\n"", u'\n  These condoms are good, cheap and wont break. Theyre nicely lubricated and dont dry up ever! But they arent ultra sensitive or anything like that, theyre still averagely thick, but hey its a condom and pretty much all cheap ones are. Its jus annoying when condoms are advertised as something that theyre not and they all feel the exact same.\n', u""\n  Well, my girlfriend isn't pregnant, so that's a plus.

The condom goes on a bit tight, but the way it feels is amazing."", u'The regular ultra thin is awesome. It appears to be very strong and hold up very well through rigorous work. Even from pulling out exposing it to the air, it showed no signs of weakening or tearing. The ultra thin is a guinness book of world records setter (as all the condoms are.) I thought that was just a gimmick as I\'ve tried several ""ultra thin"" products. No my friends, this is in another league of it\'s own. The smell is actually quite nice. It is somewhat floral, yet I can\'t seem to figure out exactly what it is. I\'ve has terrible smells from very high name brand condoms which actually make the experience not as good. When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it\'s not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don\'t expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.', u""The extra smooth is very similar to the regular. Everything still rings true on this condom. It allows for a bit less friction. If I read on the packaging it is almost like a lotion for your insides. I'm not sure if I can vouch for that yet. I do know it is a bit more slick and that's all I've noticed so far."", u""Overall, I had a very pleasant experience with these condoms. I think they are well made and feel great. They are a bit on the pricey side, yet I understand why they have such a premium. With this product you get 24 condoms in a very nice box. It's very high quality."", u'I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.\n', u'\n  I would be very hesitant to purchase these again in the future, and would be highly unlikely to recommend them to anyone who wants the preventative benefits of wearing this hoodie.', u'The first box, the ultrathin, was good.  Quite good, in fact.  My wife and I found them to be far more enjoyable to use than other hoodies we had used in the past.  I was a little disappointed in the near lack of a seed storage area at the tip, it did require some getting used to.', u""The second box, the ultrasmooth, was just plain bad.  We had one break during installation, and two additional failures during usage.  This box also seemed smaller, girth-wise, and made installation more of a chore.  They were not expired, so I don't know what the excuse for failure was.  We decided not to risk it and tossed the last few remaining from this box."", u'The only reason that these get 2 stars is because of the one good box, it was really good.', u""The one bad box, well, it was really bad.  You shouldn't have this high a failure rate with this type of product, especially considering the price.  OK, I agree, this should be a one star, I talked myself into it."", u'I received this product at a discount or without charge for the purpose of testing, evaluation, and providing a review for future customers.  All of the opinions within the review are my own.  I am not affiliated with the manufacturer or seller of any of the products that I provide this service for.  My reviews are my independent evaluations of the provided products, and I base my ratings of the product on the full sale price at the time I purchased.\n', u'\n  So, after some hesitation, I decided to pull the trigger and order a box of condoms online. I got them at a discount in exchange for my honest, review, so I decided why not? Cheap condoms! (when has that every been a problem...?)', u""These condoms purport to be the world's thinnest and have studies and awards to prove it, which is pretty neat. I can definitely say that they are some of if not THE thinnest condoms I've ever used. They are also extremely well-lubed. These are all good things that we want in a condom. So why four stars instead of five? Even the box they come in is minimalistic but cleverly made and vibrant."", u""The four stars come from two small issues: because the condoms are super thin, they are also super tight. In the heat of the moment, I have experienced some (minor) difficulty getting the condom on. Look, I'm fortunate enough to be pretty average to slightly above in terms of size, and I imagine that anyone that is actually seriously well-endowed (especially girth-wise) will have issues putting these condoms on. They were made in China. My other issue is that there is a lot of lube packed into each one of these guys on the outside. Putting one on involves getting your hands pretty slick/lube-y. Again, these are not serious issues but minor complaints, but they are enough to keep me from rating it a perfect 5-star product.\n"", u""\n  Very nice. A lot thinner than your average drug store condom. They almost feel like your guy has nothing on at all. OK after using these a few times I feel like I must change my review, yes they are thin. But the run very small so if you have any size at all they fit tight (or so my husband told me). They also tended to break on us 2 out of 3. I know condoms break but the 2 out of 3 times I mean what if that was your only form of birth control or protection from STD's?\n""]","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0179TIWE0,11.2 ounces ( ),11.2,

The variety is good for those who are first-time users of condoms (so it gives a chance to see what they like), and they are high quality (we didn't have any problems with breakage or anything). The box comes with four different condoms (Twisted Pleasure, Intense, Her Pleasure, and Fire and Ice). I will review each condom type:"", u'The Fire and Ice are good for women who are virgins. This is because the Icy-Hot-type of lubrication thereon helps her muscles and skin to be a little more numb than usual down there, which allows for the necessary stretching, without nearly as much pain for her. After a few uses, the transition to other condoms (or not using condoms) is a lot easier for her.', u'Her Pleasure is really great for helping her to experience an orgasm a lot better. It takes women a lot longer to get ""spooled up"" (if you will) for an orgasmic experience than a man. As long as time it taken for her to get near to that before insertion, these condoms will definitely help her get there.', u'The Twisted Pleasure are very nice for putting a new spin on the intimate experience. My wife and I definitely enjoyed this one.', u'The Intense condoms were our favorite, once my wife had had enough sexual experience. The really deep ridges were enough to provide a plethora of pleasure for both of us. We highly recommend this Pleasure Pack.', u'With the purchase of this, we would also recommend purchase of a bottle of lubrication..We have yet to find a condom that comes with enough lubrication in and of itself.\n', u'\n  When I bought this I was a little skeptical, even with it being trojan. However when I started using them the more I said to myself that this was a good buy. There is four types of condoms in this and they are not all even, two of the types has more than the other two. The most that I have used is the fire and ice because of how the girl likes the feel of it. tow of the types have ribs on them that add more stimulation to them, twisted and her pleasure. overall if i had to i would get this again\n', u'\n  4-in-1 variety keeps things interesting rather than pulling from the same pack over and over again. Buying in ""bulk"" also keeps prices low, which is always a plus for perishable goods.', u""As far as the individual choices, once you get past the colorful wrapper it's hard to notice the difference (from both the male and female perspective) but they all get the job done. These options are all safe choices.\n"", u""\n  What's there to say...these are Trojans, they are good. Haha only problem I had with them was that I received 8 that were the ultra thin ones I never tried before and they don't work for me. But it wasn't an issue because I just use them as ones when a friend is in need.\n"", u'\n  You can\'t go wrong buying in bulk, especially with a variety like this one. It\'s nice to have options or to be able to be ""surprised"" when you randomly grab one from your drawer.\n', u'\n  This is something awesome. The selection of stuff gave a great option. They feel great for both partners but favorite was the ultra ribbed. Good stuff indeed!!\n', u""\n  Delivered on time and in Perfect condition; the variety is very nice but my husband complained that the twisted condoms leaves him with a nasty sore feeling.

The ultrathin are basically regular condoms besides the fact that they're so thin. The over-time condoms we were rather excited to try, but honestly they weren't that great. They come in sets with silicon rings(basically cock rings crossed with zip ties). Like cock rings, the purpose is to constrict blood flow and thus allow men to maintain their erection for a longer period of time. But these are not that comfy to wear compared to a good quality cock ring.

For those of us who consider such amorous affairs the stuff of hours of mutually stimulating and exciting personal encounters, nature can sometimes fail us by running of of steam and juices. In such circumstances, use of one of these specially designed and lubricated condoms can be of immeasurable assistance in putting the lovemaking back on track and back into gear. Buying them in quantity also makes sense, so if you love to make love, and recognize sometimes nature doesn't necessarily know best, try using these and see how much they add to your staying power and ability to make it an entire afternoon of love and passion.

We were using Trojan classic ribbed non-spermicide prior to using Sir Richard's, but we have also used Lifestyles and Durex.  The first thing my husband noticed was that these were thinner than Trojans, but still felt durable.  They did not have any odor (something about condoms that ALWAYS annoyed me!), and they did not leave any weird aftertastes or smells if you fool around later...after 3 months of regular use, we're going to stick with these."", u""I'm going to share the pros and cons from a woman's perspective (for those interested):"", u'Pros:', u'- These condoms have, in my opinion, the best texture and feel of any male condom.  They are ribbed, which adds a little extra texture and friction that I personally enjoy (the ultra thin were like silk - no friction at all. They are as close to au natural as he has felt to me while wearing a condom. The pleasure dots were incredible, but a little too much for me to experience all the time!).  I could see where this would depend on the person, however.', u'- There is no aftertaste, no odor, and no physical sensation or residual lube left by the condom after use.  As someone who found her skin more sensitive after having our first child, I have to say this was the best!  The way I felt after we used this condom is actually no different than when we used no condom at all.  Anyone with chemical sensitivities or allergies can understand how important that is!', u'Friends who have had several issues with their vaginal health have also told me these condoms help keep them more balanced.', u'-  My husband has never complained about these.', u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  After ten years on the pill my wife stopped using hormonal birth control last month due to its negative effects on her emotions. Due to some allergy issues we had to find a condom that did not contain all of the usual ingredients you find in a typical Trojan, etc. We tried a sample box of Sir Richard's from our local Whole Foods (Thin, Ribbed, and Pleasure Dots) and she much preferred the Ribbed. I can't feel much difference between the three, but since she loves the feel of the Ribbed so much we go with those. A little extra lube (Astroglide Paraben free for us) is helpful for the outside, but also on the inside (after ten years 'au natural' I found finishing in the condom to be difficult and sometimes impossible - adding a little lube to the inside of the condom helps with that problem greatly and allows me to finish in a reasonable amount of time without frustration). They aren't cheap at $10 for 12, but they are good quality and consistent. We've had no breakage problems after two boxes and they open and go on easily.\n"", u""\n  I like sir richards condoms but I recently tried the ribbed ones.  When I opened it, it had a pretty nasty smell to it like gerbil or hamster food.  Something similar to that at least.  I used it anyway but it left me itchy and agitated inside.  I really hope there was nothing wrong with them :( they weren't expired and other ones I've used from the brand were ok and I didnt have problems with.  So just a warning to others...if it smells weird...don't use it. :(\n"", u'\n  No breaks and my girlfriend loves the ribs on them. Plus, they keep chlorine and other toxins that are found in most condoms out of her blood stream!

Well, my husband probably can feel it a little, since he has to wear it, but I certainly can't, and that's a first for me.  Every other latex condom on the market that we've tried has felt plasticky and not good, not real, so I always thought I had to live with that and just accept the sensation-deadening effect as an unfortunate consequence of using condoms.  These Okamotos have proven that it isn't so!  Since we discovered Okamotos years ago, they are the only brand we trust, and this particular 004 kind is by far the thinnest we have encountered."", u'Despite the thinness, the condom is very durable.  With regular intercourse and sometimes vigorous, after weeks of using them, not a single one has failed in any way -- broken, torn, or slipped off.  I enthusiastically recommend them.\n', u""\n  These condoms make you truly feel like you're wearing nothing! I've used the Crowns and Beyond Sevens and these are a bit more sensitive than those are.

The fit is just a standard fit compared to the crowns which are nice and snug and feel like they stay in place the whole time. The color is just standard clear and nothing special, I'd like them to be colored something like how the crowns are pink and the beyond sevens are blue. I can buy a 100 pack of crowns or beyond sevens for $15 but these will run you about a $1 a piece. Are they worth the price? I say absolutely! I can feel everything and I mean everything like every last little bump and ridge inside a girl!\n"", u'\n  These are also great condoms for the sensation of almost wearing nothing at all.

We have used Trojan (her pleasure) mostly in the past which were okay and didn\'t break on us but these condoms stand out. The certainly feel more pleasurable for me and she climaxes much easier during sex with these than the Trojan brand (I\'m assuming this is because of the little ribbed pouch.) We used all 12 and didn\'t have any problems with them breaking. I believe these would fit anyone from 4.5""-6"" as I am 6"" and average girth and I feel like they would be too tight if I were any bigger.', u'Overall a great buy! Plus you can buy 12 on Amazon for approx. $5 with shipping and a 3 pack in the store is approx. $3\n', u'\n  My wife has an ill reaction to the pill so we use condoms.  I have used Trojan, durex, and life styles to name a few.  I saw the deal on Amazon for a 36 pack of ONE condoms for $5 so i said why not?', u""These things rock.  They have a unique fit and feel.  I won't go back to the other brands again."", u""Just FYI they don't come in a box, they were in a bag.  Not a big deal.\n"", u'\n  This is such an improvement over regular condoms and even ""female condoms"" that I\'ll never use anything else. The degree of sensation by having subtle ribs on the inside, under the head (yeah, there\'s a top and bottom on the sucker) makes having safe sex a real pleasure.\n', u""\n  I finally figured out how to open these. In the dark its hard to see that the top center has a slight rip to tear it open from. I am used to just opening a condom from any side or angle so thats a downside to these guys. If you have a genital piercing then these work well otherwise I don't see the point of the extra head room.\n"", u""\n  I've never been thrilled about using condoms. My biggest complaint would be that most condoms decrease sensation and this condom is the only exception to that that I have found so far. They are great! I am married and we only use condoms occasionally and these are the only ones we will use. You have to try it to believe it. They area amazing.\n"", u""\n  I'm not a man so this is second-hand information, but these rock! My partner said they felt really nice compared to normal condoms. All the expiration dates were a long ways off, and not a single one broke. While these aren't our go-to condoms, I'll probably be keeping a few in my nightstand from here on out."", u""Note: If you don't last as long as you'd like to in bed, you might want to try another condom because these will only increase sensation.\n"", u""\n  Great product, the proverbial better widget.  Truly - pleasure, PLUS.  It's as close as a guy can come to getting his foreskin back."", u""When I discovered these (in 1995?) they were Mnfd in China, dist. by Global Protection Corp, Boston MA, but then they went away for awhile. Now, upon rediscovering the current Pleasure Plus, I see they are made in Malaysia, Mnfd by One, Boston MA.  Either I've gotten thicker over the years, or these got narrower & to be honest I'm at an age where things are shrinking.  I find this new version a little tight which kills some of the Plus compared to the original.  I still recommend this product, it's worth a try at the least.  At worst you'll discover a good condom, at best if it fits you right you'll discover pleasure amplified.  I've never had one break.  I do wish they would add a color dot or little bump on the top side to make it easier to get it on right as there is a top & bottom to these.\n"", u'\n  My girlfriend wanted to try these, So I got some.

By not being latex they have much better heat transfer. The woman puts the female condom inside of her so the man isn\'t wearing a condom at all. They are thicker than condoms and less likely to break. At the same time, they feel closer to ""nothing at all"" than any other condom on the market. At first it\'s awkward to put them inside, but after you learn how you can easily do so discreetly while giving your partner oral. Even though they are expensive and ugly, they are my favorite way to have safe sex!\n', u'\n  These ""condoms"" are fantastic, they have an uncomfortable inner ring to aid in insertion, but it can be removed before or after insertion. They are latex free so those sensitive to latex will be unaffected, and best of all they feel amazing. The only downside is it needs a bit more lubrication than is given, so keep your favorite lubricant on hand.\n', u""\n  My girlfriend and I love these condoms. They feel ten times better than standard condoms and this condom can be inserted before you get the ball rolling so no awkward pause in order to be safe. These condoms are as safe as regular condoms and are the only way to go if you are going to use condoms. While they are more expensive the extra money spent is not wasted they're worth every penny. Get some today.\n"", u""\n  The female condom is a good alternative to male condoms and I do recommend it, but unless it's placed properly it can be a little uncomfortable. The lubrication also makes it kind of messy, but it would be much worse without it. I've been using them for a long time. They are sturdy and I will continue to use them since the benefits outweigh the negatives.\n"", u""\n  These are so great! They're way more comfortable for me (less chafing and irritation), and more fun for him. The only problem is that there isn't enough lube, so you need to buy some to add -- I wish it said that on the package, because it took us a while to figure out why it wasn't working at first.\n"", u""\n  After years of being on the pill, doctor took me off of them.  So, back to condoms for me and my husband.  Regular male condoms are really restrictive for my husband and it is hard for him to get any enjoyment when using one.  Then we found these!  These are great!  I'd suggest anyone new to them look for videos on youtube on how to insert (instructions are on the packet, but there are useful videos that help).  I tend to place a little extra lube, LITTLE is the key term, on the outside of the condom and then insert.  Husband adds lube to the inside of the condom before we start.  Works wonderfully!  Husband has full sensation as do I, not restrictive for him and when we are done he simply holds the outer lip of the condom and slowly pulls it out with him.  Super easy and quick.  I just wish these were easier to find and when you do, less expensive.  But, thanks to Amazon, much more affordable.  For us they are wonderful and recommended!\n""]","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BPPG7J2,1 pounds,,

We also use the Strawberry flavored condoms offered by Trustex.  Another selling point was that as we ordered the 12pk we received a 15 count..

It was tight and I had to work to slide it down my shaft. After 3 minutes the condom broke. Then I put a new condom on and that one broke. Such a mood killer. I won't buy these again and I like Durex condoms.\n"", u""\n  after years of trying to find the perfect latext or non-latex condom, i finally found it. Durex has always been my first choice but they now have made me a permanent loyal patron of their product. this is it boys! this condom right here its the closest thing to good ol' barebacking and it is awesome!\n"", u""\n  Very difficult to roll down all the way. Will go through like 3 condoms each time trying to get one that doesn't get stuck rolling down. Don't have this issue with other durex condoms. Did give it 2 stars instead of just 1 because at least once it's on, it works. No broken ones. Still wouldn't buy again though.\n"", u'\n  I ""subscribe & save"" ordered off this exact product page a few months ago and received AVANTI BARE POLYISOPRENE (LATEX-FREE) CONDOMS, as advertised. My auto-shipment just sent me my 2nd order and when it arrived, the box looked identical but the word ""LATEX"" caught my eye. It turns out that Amazon CHANGED the listing so that what was a polyisoprene condom for those with latex allergies is now automatically shipping a LATEX condom with a nearly identical box and name. This is VERY dangerous, especially for those who subscribed to these and don\'t read the box because it looks the same. People can get very ill or die from this oversight on Amazon\'s part.', u""I wanted to make sure this wasn't my error, so I went and pulled out the condoms I received from the first shipment when I subscribed. As I expected, they are the correct Avanti Bare NON-LATEX/POLYISOPRENE condoms."", u'I searched my gmail account which saves all emails and found every email regarding my avanti bare orders...sure enough, there was never a notification of product change. Sometime between April and June, the product and product page were changed (not the link or subscriptions though).', u'Immediately upon receiving the latex version today, I contacted Amazon to escalate the issue (spoke with Nicholas). I then searched Amazon for ""polyisoprene condoms"" with prime shipping checked and THIS LATEX VERSION is the FIRST product that comes up. Why? Because it used to be latex free/polyisoprene, but they changed it without notifying anyone or changing the search terms. PLEASE be careful if you have a latex allergy!!!\n', u""\n  Apparently not good for the larger end of 'average' or large.  Hard to get on wide girth, tends to want to come off.\n"", u'\n  but latex is not a soft as other formulations.', u'on the other hand provides better protection.', u'safety versus feel, your choice.\n', u'\n  This product has not enough lubrication. It is not thin enough  as well. I am totally not satisfied with it.\n', u""\n  These and the Trojan Bareskin condoms are my two favorites.  Both are probably the thinnest condoms available that I've used.  The Avanti Bares work great.  No breakages or failures of any kind.  I think they fit a little tighter all around compared to the Trojan Bareskins.  They're made in Thailand while the Trojans are made in the USA.  So these may be geared towards a slightly less endowed male population.  Also, these are less lubricated than the Trojan Bareskins, so you'll definitely need some extra lube!  Overall, my girlfriend and I enjoy using these.  Safe, sensitive, and reliable!\n""]","[u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'1.0 out of 5 stars', u'3.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001XUQOEW,6 x 5 x 4 inches,,

It contained 18 Crown, 12 Crown Assorted Colors, and 18 Beyond Seven condoms, and 2 vibrator rings in a sealed package which each come with 1 Unil@tex condom (Malaysia), so technically you are getting 50 condoms.  The vibrating rings are intended for single use and last about 45-60 minutes.  They are kind of fun, but my GF said they are not intense enough (but she likes very intense clitoral stimulation).', u'The only issue I have with this order is the packaging in which the condoms were shipped.  They arrived in one of those bubble padded envelopes with no durable protection around them.  I noticed a tear and a hole in the envelope which prompted me to inspect each and every condom carefully.  I found two condoms which had holes in the wrappers, presumably from whatever made the holes in the shipping envelope, so my advice is to thoroughly inspect every condom wrapper front and back before you start using them.', u""One other thing you should know about these condoms is they are represented to be Japanese condoms, which I trust, but these are actually made in Thailand.

Why does this matter? Because of the law of environmental replacements. A used condom used in place of an eco-unfriendly balloon is a balloon that never existed... so how green is that? At a wedding, the wedding coordinator can fill all the happy couple's saved used condoms with helium, then release them as the bride exits the church, making for a very meaningful and moving fertility ceremony. If the groom gets a little help from his friends in filling out the used condom bouquet, there may be enough condomiums to lift the flower girl into the air, which is a blessing on the marriage and a sure promise of fecundity. Plus, all the trash that flower girl would have created during her life is probably not going to be a problem now.

WRONG (I pity those with latex-allergies! Sucks to be you). Back to latex and we tried some Durex Extra-Sensitives, they fit SO bad. They kept bunching up at the top and creating friction so uncomfortable I kept having to stop. I was about to go back to our trusty Trojans when I decided to try these since the price was so enticing. I LOVE THEM. They fit so well! No bunching. No slipping off at the base. No breaking. Nothing bad at all and super thin to boot!', u'They are all pink which is funny.', u'To those complaining about getting a bag full of condoms in the mail instead of excess packaging (depending on the vendor): Shame on you! They\'re already individually wrapped! I personally hate unnecessary packaging, not only from a ""green"" standpoint but a convenience one as well.', u'p.s. I\'m sorry I used the word ""green"" I personally hate the slogan but it fit.\n', u""\n  These are really then and very close to having nothing on at all. They are minimally lubed so they don't feel greasy or sticky, and they don't carry that horrible latex smell that many other brands do. Never had an issue of breakage so far. Recommended.\n"", u""\n  I was really hoping that the hype about these was true, and it is. These are very thin and very strong. The thinness actual lets you feel tiny movements while wearing one. I did some crazy stretching tests, and couldn't get one to break. I've had horrible problems with Trojan condoms, but these feel great and I actually trust them. They are fairly tight, but that contributes to the sensation. They are a little more difficult to put on than average, but it's worth the extra effort. They fit well for me (above average length/girth). They are as wide as most condoms, but only seven inches long. These things are an incredible value.\n"", u""\n  I often have an issue with condoms where it becomes difficult for me to finish due to a distinct decrease in sensation , but these condoms are remarkably thin and feel almost as if you aren't wearing one at all. Also, thankfully, as thin as they may be, they still feel durable, which of course is a very important quality for a condom to have.\n"", u""\n  After researching laboriously online I discovered that Okamoto no longer makes these condoms in Japan but in Thailand. Other users have said how this affects how thin and reliable the condoms actually are but I have not had any from the Japan batch so I wouldn't know. My shipment was from thailand. But overall these condoms are very thin and give a VERY close fit. Im average size and girth and they work great for me. If you are larger though I would suggest getting a looser fit since these might be stretched quite a bit and not feel as good. So just be warned that these are made in Thailand and I HAVE heard of some breaking, but so far I have not had any break on me (a little bit over 10 used at this point.)\n"", u""\n  This is an amazing brand, the thinnest condoms I've ever used; literally almost like nothing is there. They're like a pinkish color. People say that since the company has started making their condoms in Thailand that they've fallen in quality. This is not true, after extensive research I've learned that the quality is exactly the same, exact same production methods, although the dimensions for the condom have changed slightly; it's much more tighter now. Was delivered on time, great price, great quality, doesn't get much better than this!\n"", u'\n  I have to admit I was skeptical that these condoms would give the ""as close to wearing nothing at all"" feeling, but they do.  My partner can\'t tell when I wear one, which is unusual with other condoms.  Like other reviews indicate, they do fit very snug, and are a little on the small side, but for the ""natural"" feeling they give, I find the negatives are not bad.\n', u'\n  Ok, I know this can be a touchy issue but I dont know how else to say it except to say that if you want to feel the real thing, use these condoms because Im telling you now you can feel the warmth and everything!

My spouse and I have not used a vibration ring before and wanted to try a cheaper, more disposable option before investing in a more expensive option. The ring worked well the entire time we had intercourse, and still vibrates, so in theory you could use the ring again as long as the battery lasts.

I'm not the cockness monster but these definitely would not work as well for average/smaller size guys. They feel great, the lube actually lasts as long as it needs to, and overall I think they are my favorite condom for comparing feel/lubrication quality. I've found a couple of the condoms in each box tends to have a strange/off putting odor, but generally speaking they are fine smell wise. Despite the occasional rankness I gave them a deserving 5, but I have never had one break and they work phenomenally!\n"", u'\n  These are hands down the worst condoms I\'ve ever had the misfortune of using.  Opening the box, they look like they are designed for horse; Ron Jeremy couldn\'t use these condoms effectively.  That ""room for movement"" actually means that it looks and feels like you\'re putting a sandwich bag on your penis and fastening it with a rubber band (my fiance reports that\'s what it feels like to her too).  Texturally, the ribs are reminiscent of the molted skin from the movie Alien.  You get almost no feeling of sliding, just pressure.  I think you\'d get more sensation using a latex glove.  In short, only use this condom if your choice is it or no sex, otherwise get anything else!\n', u""\n  I bought a 10 pack of these and only used three. They're as wide as any extra-wide condom you'll buy, which is NOT advertized anywhere, which is extremely annoying. As others have said, I'm not the cockness monster, but I certainly am not small, and these were too loose. Another one in the box was tighter than the other two I used, and while it fit correctly...I could definitely tell I was wearing a condom. The three times we've used these have been our three most disappointing times we've had intercourse, my first time even being much better."", u'The only other brands I\'ve used were generic style Trojans, which were alright, and Beyond Seven ""Sheerlon"", which were amazing. If you\'re looking for a reliable condom that feels like nothing is there, go with Beyond Seven. They don\'t ACTUALLY feel like nothing is there, (no condom will) but after a few minutes of lovemaking with them on it will feel like they\'re not there. Almost every time I\'ve used them I\'ve stopped at least once to make sure it hadn\'t fallen off.\n', u'\n  My partner and I gave these a go and came to a solid conclusion:', u""The feeling is something oddly reminiscent of what we imagine a trash bag to feel like. We use Trojan because other brands are too small and simply won't fit-so that is not the issue by any means."", u'As a female reviewer I can honestly tell you it cuts off most sensation and makes for a very frustrating time. My partner agrees with my opinion but obviously from the male side of the spectrum. Neither of us enjoyed these or found ecstasy.

After struggling with protection being a smooth transition, I finally decided to purchase this product some months ago and give it a whirl. It has made wonderful difference, and has increased the ease of the transition of applying protection dramatically. It lives up to the marketing, and I'm very pleased to find a source that is very reasonably priced. I didn't think anyone could beat Target's price, and it counts towards Amazon Mom purchases (which I just find amusing because of the irony.) Girlfriend gives a big thumbs up!\n"", u""\n  I was recently introduced to these and have to say that these are a great improvement over the regular magnums.  The dimensions and fit are exactly the same which is much more comfortable than any regular sized condom, but the material is much thinner.  This translates to more feel, but they certainly aren't as thin as regular thin condoms.  The fit and added sensation make me a fan of these, but I will continue searching for the perfect larger sized condom that has no compromises in fit, sensation, and overall feeling.  Until then these will work perfectly and she is a fan of them also so that's always a big plus.\n"", u'\n  The fit is on par with regular trojan magnums, which is very nice.

I've used Trojan, Durex, and a bunch of other brands before, but this is the thinnest and feels the best."", u'In addition to being thin, this condom seems to be slightly smaller than American ones in terms of girth (circumference).  This in turn made the condom even thinner when worn because it gets stretched more.', u'But this may be too sensitive if the guy is looking to prolong his endurance.

Kimono's get the job done and have the most sensation of all of ultrathins I've tried. (Durex, Lifestyles, Trojan)  Bigger gentleman (<~6.5 inches) be warned:  This product is not built for you. Check out the Kimono's large version which fits and protects better.  Also be more careful when handling and using these, if you and your lover are crazy rough in the bedroom you'll want to look out or consider using Durex extra sensitive which is almost as good and sturdier.  Also if you don't put it on right on a frequent basis you'll also want to look elsewhere as they can fail easy if not used correctly.  If you're looking for more sensation and better sex for you and your lover,  I highly recommend these as long as you treat them carefully.\n"", u'\n  ', u'So this is my third review of condom brands. While you may have preferences to feel, comfort, security or are just brand-loyal, I encourage you to safely try the Kimono brand of condoms. These latex, Japanese-made condoms are the best on the market, I believe. Despite the other brand of condoms you can get in bulk and for dollars, this is still a value even if you were to shop retail for condoms (at the drugstore).', u""I am a big fan of Kimono condoms; they have never broken on me, are the thinnest in the market, and give me a real sense of security and safety when using them. Though some might buy condoms with the only goal in mind: to save money and get in bulk, they often overlook quality and the track record of the condom. Not only are these condoms highly rated and manufactured to the strictest of guidelines and tests, but knowing the Japanese and their infusion of tradition into their manufacturing, honor in craftsmanship is a real asset for manufacturing condoms. And so not one has broken on me, nor failed to meet expectations-a common area most other condom companies don't bother to look closely into."", u""For the price vs quantity, this is a real deal! The picture of the product looks nothing like the ones shipped to me and with normal reasoning; the picture is simply outdated. Same product advertised, but the manufacturer ships them in this elegant and classy box approx the same size. Amazon shipped it to me, and it came in a box and SEALED! Very nice, and I can't stress how important that is! You never ever want to have the fate of an unexpected pregnancy rest on the carelessness of a seller that ships damaged condoms to your doorstep.

It's very thin as advertised and I like the minimal lubrication(non-water based, no smell, no taste) on it. If I want to more lube, I would add more of what I buy separately.\n"", u""\n  Great condom. Thin with great sensitivity, less nasty smell (not completely absent IMO), just the right amount of lube. And they're cheap!! Only problem I have is they're a little tight and do tend to slip off a little. I've never had one come completely off though. Would definitely buy again.\n"", u""\n  We've tried many, many different thin (some dangerously so!) condoms and I have to say that this was by far the BEST condom.  Very thin - almost feels like nothing is there - but also very reliable.  No slips, leaks or other surprises.  Package says made in Thailand.  Can't imagine a better feel than these!\n"", u'\n  The 12 Pack Of Crown Condoms arrived very quickly, and in very good condition. The actual condoms are in a BLUE container, not a silver container. This is ok since it is the condom, not the packaging of the condom, that really matters. My girlfriends and I are pleased...\n', u""\n  These are by far the best condoms I have ever used (previous brands/products trojan, lifestyle, durex, magnum, and iron grip. After things get a little warmed up these condoms feel unbelievably natural. It took me a few  times to get comfortable with them because you begin to feel like they are coming off because things feel so natural but these condoms aren't going anywhere until you rip them off. We ALL know that feeling where we are into it but we know the condom is one and then things feel a little TOO good and we pull out and look down to see if the condom came off. Not the case with these. If you put them on correctly and unroll them all the way down, they stay on and suck and stick to your skin. I pulled out on more than one occasion and saw that the condom was still on, tried to pull it off because I thought it leaked or broke and the condom was like a suction cup and was not coming off, period. Didn't do much for the mood but it gave me confidence that these puppies are not coming off in the heat of the a moment. We all know the infamous position that makes most condoms traditionally slide off. This one stayed on no matter how hard, fast, deep or slow the action got. Again, the key is to put it on CORRECTLY. If you do that it's not going anywhere. I'm buying a larger pack and will stick with this brand going forward.\n"", u'\n  This condom is very high quality. The packages that I received were made in japan. Best one that I have tried. It was very difficult to break with my hands even though they are soo thin.', u'I bought this and 2 other types from the same company.

The instructions and functionality are extremely ambiguous on which of the 3 buttons to press/hold or tap (still trying to make sense of it all), but what is obvious is there are many more patterns than suggested in the manual. I\'ve also noticed there seem to be one or two of the patterns where the harmonics of the motor can change ever so slightly be it to glans positioning or otherwise to give you a truly ""random"" experience.\n', u""\n  Takes a very long time to build up if you're using it hands free, just leaving it in place. If you take a more manual approach massaging it around it's still takes some time but significantly less. Seems to take forever to charge but it lasts more than enough time to do its job. Almost too intense for me and leaves my head numb, but strong and satisfactory.\n"", u'\n  This is a major departure in male self pleasure. Just about every device out there tries to replicate the sensations of sex or hand stroking. This takes a very different approach, delivering gradual sensory overload to a guy\'s most sensitive nerve endings. I had my doubts that this would work for me but as it is a different technological approach, a different mind-set is what makes it work. This isn\'t a device for a quickie. Plan some time to relax, sit back, get that favorite fantasy going in your mind and then go through the settings. The buttons are easy to use and very responsive. Some thick water based lube increases vibration transfer. Just click it on and then click through the vibration patterns until things happen. The first time, it was sneaky. I felt good  but not great and then I hit one setting which pushed all of my buttons at once and about a minute later without any thrusting or stroking of any kind, I exploded. As I felt myself passing the point of no return I even thought, ""This can\'t be happening!""\n', u'\n  i love this toy. finaly a vibrator for men. i find the cobra libre will get me off in no time even after Iv already shot my load a few times.if you have ever liked the way a massager feels on your cock you will like this toy. its about 2 or 3 inches deep but it works great.\n', u""\n  Failed after three days. Used twice. Not sure why it failed, but since it's a sealed unit I can only guess that it could not handle its own vibrations.\n"", u""\n  I've had this for over a year now, and it is my go-to toy for convenience and sensation. I happen to enjoy vibrations (especially strong ones like from the Hitachi Magic Wand) and this generally delivers in the right place (the glans). Although they are nowhere near as strong as the Hitachi, focusing on the right spot really works for me. It does take some getting used to, and I needed to experiment with positioning, but once I got it, it can get me off nicely. It is reasonably quiet and discrete\n""]","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'2.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NXEVA04,6.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches,,

When it arrived it smelled so strongly of chemicals that I had to let it air out for a couple of days as I was afraid to put it on my dog.  When I did put it on my dog I was kinda surprised at how simple the item actually is, it is essentially a velcro belt molded to a large piece of leather which acts like a shield between the studs member and any potential female.  This would have worked, except that the stud stopper kept falling back so low on my male dog's hips that it was on the wrong side of his genitals, and therefore wasn't going to stop anything.  I adjusted and tightened the strap a couple of times, but I couldn't get it tight enough fitting without becoming overly constricting to my dog's abdomen to keep it in place."", u""I emailed the seller informing her of the problem, and was disappointing when she responded defensively, and claimed that I never submitted measurements per the email from her company.  I responded back informing her that no such ordering information requests existed on the Stud Stopper Amazon listing, just a general prefab size and weight range. She then spent several emails backpedaling and generally giving the impression that she didn't know what her listing even said, and indicated she would change the listing and that I could send the product back with measurements and she'd try to fix it.  I responded that I would be interested in that, but then never heard from her again when I inquired what measurements specifically she needed to make the adjustments."", u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  We got this for our Golden Retriever stud...  He wears it ok, it doesn't seem to bother him, but sometimes I've noticed it works it's way a little too far back to be effective, if you know what I mean.  I certainly love the concept, as there are times when we don't want to breed, but I don't think I will completely trust this device.  Our girls will have to continue visiting with their Aunty Barbie for a couple of weeks.  It might work fine for other types of dogs.  We got the gold color, it is really a bright gold, so maybe tan would have been better...\n"", u'\n  Took measurement around his waste for a perfect fit.  Item stays on and the dog is able to jump, run and play as well as pee while wearing this device. Works for us as a reliable barrier in preventing him having undesirable physical contact with female dogs.\n', u'\n  I found this very innovative product when I was in a panic having had my 1.5 yr old German Shepherd go into heat after getting a Maremma Sheepdog that was 6 months old. The logistics of keeping these friends separate would have been daunting. We put the Stud Stopper on him and were able to allow them to be in the same enclosure. What a fabulous idea this is! The quality of the product is obvious. We got many questions when people saw him wearing his ""apron."" The proof in the product is that we do not have an unexpected litter while determining whether she will be part of a breeding program. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a need to avoid an unplanned pregnancy. The inventors are fabulous and were always able to answer questions with knowledge and humor.\n', u""\n  Very cheap and a rip off...it's like $2.50 worth of vinyl and a piece of black elastic and cost $50.00...the dog pulls it off within 5 minutes of putting it on him.  Worthless waste of money.\n"", u'\n  I really did not think that a ""flap"" would work to keep two dogs determined to reproduce unsuccessful. Much to my surprise they did not work together to rip it off of the male. I did have to add a detail to keep it from coming off of him but it was very simple and proved to be an amazingly efficient and effective form of birth control. The two dogs in question are American Staffordshire Terriers. For those who are familiar with the breed will understand that this is quite a feat. Being a powerful and acrobatic pair I was much amazed and happy at the outcome with this heat cycle. Of course you do not just put it on and leave it until the heat is over. One must be a responsible and attentive  pet owner; as well as a responsible and demanding parent when necessary.\n', u'\n  We were unwise to think that we would be successful at keeping our breeding dogs apart during an undesired heat. We tried diapers, crating, but nothing was a viable solution until the stud stopper. The dogs got to simulate mating, exhaust their instincts, and ultimately we have no puppies which is the desired result! The male dog was able to urinate and fulfill his biological needs, without mating our female dog.\n', u'\n  This product was perfect!  When visiting friends and family, we always take Scooter everywhere we go.  This allows us to visit without worrying about keeping them apart.  With the Stud Stopper we are able to enjoy time together vice letting our pets aggravate and dominate our attention.

These are BY FAR the best condoms I have ever used. They do not have a rubber smell, they're thin, and extremely durable. Best of all, unlike latex condoms, they do not dry me out! I read where a few others have complained about them fitting a bit snug, but my man had no issue with them. Try them out, I'm willing to bet you'll love them.\n"", u'\n  the studs created a very interesting sensation, so no complaints there. However, the smell is a little funky, and i dont know what i think about it. overall its a thin condom and my girlfriend enjoyed the studs very much\n', u'\n  These are the best condoms on the market for my money. She loves the studs, we both prefer a lack of lubrication, they are very very thin, not like nothing, not really even close, but nothing ever will be. The purple color is pretty cool though, not that that matters. The best, absolute best thing about these condoms is the price though. Getting 100 for the price of 12 at the brick and mortar stores. Amazing deal, on a really fantastic product.\n', u""\n  My girlfriend enjoys the small bumps on here, and it is a nice to have some of these around in order to break up the monotony of typical condoms. The bumps aren't overly intense, and are really only felt in a significant way by her. But, hey, making her happy is the name of the game right?\n"", u""\n  Can't complain about the price, but the ring feels too constricting for me enough that I do not enjoy myself. Look for a larger size if you may experience this problem.\n"", u""\n  Overall these are awesome.  They are pretty thin, the studs add some thickness, but very little.  The texture is great, the wife is happy, and so am I.  Haven't had any problem with these breaking, although they are snug.  I recommend these.\n"", u'\n  These are my favorite condoms. They are very thin allowing for maximum sensitivity and just slightly smaller than regular at 50mm width(regular is 52mm). That minor difference makes ALL the difference. Sometimes regular condoms would slip off, but these never do. This is all I use now. The price was fantastic and they were shipped very quick.\n', u'\n  This is a good product for the price and the amount of condoms that you get.  Now as for the studding part of the condom, I couldnt feel it to the touch and my partner couldnt feel it as well.

With traditional latex condoms you have the horrible odor, reduced feeling, and lack of warmth transmitted. These both of us had much more feeling as well as no odor. They do feel and look sort of fragile but as we can attest they are quite durable. The only downside with these, at least for me is they are a little tough to put on.

I used to enjoy Durex Avanti condoms and enjoyed them even though they were like wearing a sandwich bag, but they were discontinued and replaced by Durex Avanti Bare and are unacceptable.

No joke, this happened on multiple occasions.', u""Anyway, the Supras fit well and feel pretty alright, if grading on a curve.

For anyone not familiar with that illness...you basically feel like you have a severe case of the flu every day, which includes full body muscle aches and pain along with brain fog, poor sleep, non existent sex drive, no energy...and just an overall feeling of frustration."", u""When I had first heard on the internet about Tongkat Ali being a natural way to improve not only my energy level, but also my sex drive and I just had to give it a try. It was recommended that you should only get the Indonesian form...and you should get at least 1:100 strength. After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it. I'm so glad that I made the choice that I did. I was so surprised by the results I just have to get another bottle to keep that feeling going. It made me feel like I did when I was young."", u'Read more \u203a', u'\n', u""\n  I've done many supplements.  I diet and exercise.  I've even done a cycle of synthetic testosterone many years ago and the pump, testosterone boost that I've gotten from this product of off the hook.  I only use half the recommended dosage now simply because the pump was intense."", u""I am using pine pollen with this also so I really have to see what is it.  The tongkat ali or the pine pollen.  I dont want to confuse anybody. THIS STUFF WORKS. I've tried a longjack product before and it did not come close to this."", u'I know there are a lot of products on the market that claim to have ""steroid-like"" effects.', u'Let me tell you.  THIS DOES.', u'Peace\n', u'\n  No point in saying everything that everyone else has said before. However some items of note to me personally are the fact that this product is gluten free per the ingredients list. One big upside is that this product is made in the USA not china, so you are less likely to receive pills filled with chalk or worse. I would recommended this product to a friend.I received this product at a discount or for free for my honest and unbiased review. The discount has not influenced or impacted my judgment of this product. I am not required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. This review is only my own thoughts and feelings on this item.\n', u'\n  I feel I have more energy and endurance once I started this product. The benefits are very well documented by just doing your research.  I would recommend to a friend.\n', u'\n  My husband loves this product a lot\n', u'\n  I give this product 5 stars because it has produced real results.', u'I originally ordered it to support my energy and endurance.  I work at', u'a job that keeps me on my feet 8 hours a day, five days a week. At age 71 I thought', u'I could use some help keeping my stamina elevated.', u'After taking the first bottle I could feel the difference.  Definitely good energy.', u'The bonus...a nice one..is that my libido has improved.  At first it was just an increase in very', u'pleasant erotic thoughts and dreams.  This was followed by positive physical changes.', u""I'm now on my second bottle and plan to make it a daily thing.  The price is terrific compared to others, and"", u'it is eligible for Amazon Prime', u'OldGrowthTimber\n', u""\n  I like it cause doesn't have any horrible flavor, i just did my 5 day ON and im on the fist day OFF according to how to use it, i think its still early to decide if it really work or not. But i have to say that i feel this company cares for their customers, they have emailed me like 3 times already to find out how i feel about using this product. I haven't reply to any mail until now. I will definetely update any comment about this product in the future to let you know if it worked for me or not. I like to read reviews before buying any product.\n"", u'\n  I have been using for about a month.  I researched several key libido/ed herbs and supplements before purchasing.  I have taken normal and double dosages a week at a time - 5 days on 2 days off', u'When I doubled up on this product, I noticed an aggressiveness from it.  So it does increase testosterone.  I went back to standard dosage and the aggressiveness went away.  Double dose too much for me.  I am 61, so a little help is good for the libido!', u'Yes, after extensive reading and being a guinea pig, this product does work. I have ordered multiple times while the price is right!', u'I am loving the fact that I am starting to wake up during the night with ""wood"" in my shorts!  Feels good, and it was missing. I am also noticing the women (in a sexual way) around me more in my daily activities. I am more alert and sleep better, so it has to have increased my testosterone levels.', u'It may not work for everyone, but it works for me.  All I can say is try it for at least a month.  I noticed results in two weeks and a slow gradual increase in my feeling of well-being.\n']","[u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'5.0 out of 5 stars', u'4.0 out of 5 stars']",http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088FLLK2,3.2 ounces ( ),3.2,

Well luckly I was so busy arranging other things that i forgot to include these in my goody bags because these things are an STD waiting to happen. First of all the flavoring apparently isn't all that great my partners really hated it but thats nothing compared the fact they are extremely flimsy!!!!! While having sex 2 of these broke in a row and let me tell u something like this is completely unacceptable!!!!! I have never had condoms break before but this was a back to back incident. exp date was fine not expired. Thanks to these things i will be a nervous wreck for the next six months as i get tested for any STDs and thats hoping for the best since anything other than that would be DEVASTATING!!!

Wish me luck. :(\n"", u'\n  They arrived quickly and are as advertised: 100 assorted flavored condoms, including banana, vanilla, chocolate, cola, mint, and grape.

The Trojan Ultra thins are extremely comfortable, well-lubricated, secure (non-accidental-slip proof) and MADE IN JAPAN- just like the highly rated Crown,Kimono,and Beyond Seven condoms!! Japanese manufacturing practices/facilities are of the highest standards and cleanliness."", u'I have never had these condoms break on me before-never. They are snug at the base, however, this is why they are ""non-accidental-slip proof."" A snug base is very reassuring on a standard-sized condom. Although the ultra-thin layer is not as thin as the Kimono condoms, it still feels like almost nothing at all and the heat transfer is superb. I personally have switched to this brand and I order this it from TARGET. DO NOT BUY FROM ""CONDOMMAN"" I highly recommend against it- you want something that is shipped in its original box; sealed, secure, and legitimate. Not a bag of condom links or individual packages. Most of the time, cheaper variations will be made in countries like Thailand, India, or Pakistan to cut costs. DO NOT!! buy condoms from countries listed above. Reading hundreds of reviews before going with these, I\'ve learned that most of the condoms that break, discolor or tear are the ones made in these countries- hot climates, poor manufacturing practices, and unsanitary workplace conditions. I suggest buying condoms where it specifically states- *made in USA or *made in Japan!!!!

For those of us who consider such amorous affairs the stuff of hours of mutually stimulating and exciting personal encounters, nature can sometimes fail us by running of of steam and juices. In such circumstances, use of one of these specially designed and lubricated condoms can be of immeasurable assistance in putting the lovemaking back on track and back into gear. Buying them in quantity also makes sense, so if you love to make love, and recognize sometimes nature doesn't necessarily know best, try using these and see how much they add to your staying power and ability to make it an entire afternoon of love and passion.

We decided on the assortment pack to test out the different styles this brand has to offer. My gf loved the condom that was ribbed. The ""ribbed"" pattern the sir richard condom is a little more pronounced than its durex and trojan counterparts. I loved the ultra thin condom, as it felt like there was nothing there. As a male, my biggest complaint about condoms in general, is that the reduced sensation felt when you have one on. Using the ultra thin condom, I would say I could feel about 70% more than what I feel with a normal condom on. The dotted condom was fun to use but we only kept it on for 5mins. the ""pleasure dots"" were ok but not excellent.', u""My only complaint with these sir richard condoms are that they too tight. I foresaw this problem before buying the condom. I normally use trojan magnums or The Legend made by One condoms and probably should have went for the larger condom that Sir Richards makes...if I was concerned about fit. But to be honest, though larger condoms fit me better, they often don't feel better. I find them to be boring, as they don't tend to make larger condoms fun. These condoms were fun but keep in mind if you are above average in girth, they will be tight on you.\n"", u""\n  Item came as described.

Only issue is that it's a little sticky, so you'll want a towel for your hands, and you'll want to clean up afterwards in the shower, but other than that it's great.\n"", u""\n  As a not extremely experienced person in the lubricant world, let alone silcone lubricants, I really can't comment too much compared to other brands or how it should feel. I did choose this brand based on numerous recommendations from outside sources that says System Jo is the best for anal, and is also a premium quality lubricant that is safe to use on more sex toys than other brands of lubricant. It is more expensive compared to other brands. I recently tried another brand that was half as expensive per ounce and from our experience with just skin to skin contact it felt comparable. We haven't yet tried it for traditional intercourse and likely won't use it for that often when we do, so the purpose of our purchase might be a bit different than the typical purchase."", u""All that being said, when it comes to the experience of using it, I'm willing to spend a few extra bucks to make sure we have the highest rated, best lubricant for anal or shower sex. I can't feel the difference in massages or other, but maybe my wife can. And if there is the slightest chance that by using the highest quality bottle of lubricant, we can avoid even one tight pull on skin, or extra raw rubbing, or even just make it 1/10th smoother then the extra money is worth it."", u""However, I can't confirm any of it, because like I said, I couldn't feel the difference. Still, our experience using it so far has been highly enjoyable, and long lasting... (or at least as long as we could last, the lube outlasted us) and it leaves a great silky smooth feeling after, not greasy or sitcky like a lotion or water based lube will. The only difference I could feel was in my pocketbook when making the purchase. So if you feel the risk/reward weighs the same with you as I described, then I would recommend buying this bottle for those special occasions and then a larger, cheaper bottle for more daily use. Just to be on the safe side.\n"", u""\n  I am a huge fan of this lube and have been using this kind for some time now. It doesn't dry out and everything stays lubed for what seems like ever! We use this silicone lube for things like wands, plugs, shower sex, and this brands water based for sex when we want super slippery. I wasn't a fan of shower sex till we tried this silicone lube. It doesn't wash away as easily as water based or natural lubricants. I always have a big bottle beside the bed and a smaller size for on the go.\n"", u""\n  I LOVE this stuff! It works great and you feel soft after,  not sticky. Also, a little bit goes a long way. It is silicone based though so I've heard it doesn't work with some toys. I do wish there was an inbetween size.. It comes in this small size or really big.\n"", u""\n  sticky. oily. and doesn't wash off without good soap. not sure what you're using this for. I bought this thinking it was a good value without check the size of the container.  it's tiny. and the stuff is literally thick as honey. so if you use it you have to use a lot. and it takes a good amount of soap to get it off afterwards\n"", u'\n  works great, be sure to use a tiny bit thou. I stopped using KY this is cheaper and way better and does not burn/tingle etc.', u'I still have not gotten this bottle from this company.... we will see how that goes\n', u'\n  My partner and I use this when we are intimate in a ""water"" environment. It works beautifully, does not wash off in water, but will wash off with soap and water.\n', u'\n  Simply.  The.  Best - Hand down!  Or palms up.  Or anyway you twist it.
