These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....\n",

When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.\n",

I haven't experimented with a lot of different brands or variations, but I'm as happy as I can be wearing these ultra thins. They are still the thinnest I've tried from Trojan and meet all expectations.\n",

If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to \"size up\" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.\n", 
            "\n  excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.\n", 
            "\n  My boyfriend and I are very happy with these condoms. He doesn't feel choked and I can hardly feel them. No issues at the moment. If your man is larger than most go with these. Best purchase I made in awhile\n",

            "\n  Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!\n", 
            "\n  Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.  Some other reviews have said that the lotion is too effective but I found it to work perfectly for my needs.  I guess the only way to know for each person is to try it out for yourself.\n", 
            "\n  I was kinda nervous about putting that chemical on my penis but it wasn't that bad like other reviews say. Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.\n", 
            "\n  This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, \"Do you need it?\"", 
            "In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).", 
            "For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don't already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn't recommend that you use these.  You might find out the \"hard?\" way that you don't really need any extra help.\n", 
            "\n  Never had condoms break before I've tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same \"procedure\", \"preparation\", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.\n", 
            "\n  Good condom brand. I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!\n",

            "\n  I have been a big fan of Trojan condoms forever, everyone knows of Trojan\u2019s legendary reliability. Trojan ribbed have been my go-to for some time know. I decided to try Bareskin and they do deliver on feel \u2013 it is like you are wearing nothing at all. I have had some issues with tearing/breaking, so definitely be careful as you are getting extra feel but losing some strength with the thinner condom. Overall, a good product.

            "\n  Yes, they are definitely extremely thin and they do, indeed, feel like bare skin, but I've never had an issue with a condom tearing until I got these. I've used two of them and both have torn at the tip, and I almost didn't notice it in time because it already felt like I wasn't wearing anything. I don't know if there was a quality control issue or what, but I'm not going to be using these ever again, no unwanted babies for this guy! I almost didn't write a review, but I felt like I should warn everyone of the tearing issue.\n", 
            "\n  after carefully reading all the previous reviews I decided to give this a chance, actually im very happy i did, it really feels like you are wearing nothing and the best part of this is that i did not have any problem, I really recommend it, I first ordered a pack of 10 but I already ordered 3 more :-D\n", 
            "\n  Yea they're thin for sure and you can feel more while having sex. There is a trade off between thin and strength that people need to be aware of. They do break if you are not careful, and by careful I mean well lubricated. Life pro tip: don't finish inside.\n", 
            "\n  I've used different types of confoms and have never had a problem with one breaking until this type. And it's not just a little split... His penis breaks completely through. So at least we knew. We've tried it 4 different times and they were a brand new box. Would not recommend.\n", 
            "\n  Excellent in terms of higher degree of feeling, however, be careful, had them break twice.  You can't make them thinner without sacrificing strength, a serious concern if you're trying to avoid STD or pregnancy.\n", 
            "\n  I've been buying trojan condoms for years and have always been satisfied. But this are super bad. I have had only 1 condom tearing in the last 3 years maybe. But this I had 3 tearing in the last month. I still like trojan but this 'model' is super bad dont risk it!\n",

            " . They're both made in Japan and have the same type of font/type face for the expiration date and lot number. I've tried them both and they feel identical to each other. The fit and feel to these condom are exactly the same so if had to make a guess they're both made at the same plant. I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback. I'd suggest any guy or girl that frequents bars or clubs to carry one of these with you when you go out.\n"

We were hesitant about this brand at first because before I went on the pill we tried so many different brands and there was such a loss of feeling to them, a lot of times he couldn't keep an erection while wearing one. But with this brand, it truly is the closest thing to wearing nothing! It's amazing how much better it feels than a regular condom. We only buy these and Trojan ultra thin condoms now. They are the two best brands on the market if your partner has trouble keeping an erection with a normal condom. Also, we have never had one break so they seem to work just as well. Very happy with them. Give them a try!\n",

(no pun intended , heheheh), they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful! we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn't come off and it was more of a mood killer.

I've previously only used the Magnum Thin condoms but even they sometimes (maybe even frequently) lead to such a reduction in sensitivity that gladly kills my boner.  Sure, you're always going to know you're wearing a condom but these let me feel everything, seemed to go with the movement, and seemed to be a little looser than other Magnum condoms.  Given how impossibly thin the BareSkin condoms are, the bit of extra wiggle room - whether perceived or actual - probably contributes to its strength.  If a normal sized condom feels snug and you have $8, there's ZERO reason to not try these.  I mean, who says, \"I wish the latex was a little bit thicker.\"??\n", 
            "\n  I wish they had these when I was in college! I've always hated condoms and I must have tried over 30 different brands and types over the years. These ones though I am happy with! (Well, as happy as someone can be when using them that is.) They fit well, you can feel a bit more than with other condoms, and the price is right. Just be sure to use a good lube!\n", 
            "\n  My girlfriend commented on these during our first use! She asked me if I was using a different condom, and that it felt amazing! I used to use the Trojan Magnum Thin, but these are WAY thinner, and let you feel WAY more. They also have less lubricant (FYI if that's an issue) but on the plus side they don't have the rather unpleasant lubricant smell of the Magnum Thin's and Original's.\n", 
            "\n  Taking thin to the new level.  you have tried the thins..  well, now it is time to step to the BareSkins.  I gave the thins 10 stars (well, I gave five and my girlfriend gave five).  We give these 15 stars total.  That is right, a 50% increase in mutual satisfaction.  If it can't be skin on skin, go with the BareSkins.  You will not regret it.\n", 
            "\n  Simply the best condom ever. My partner noticed the difference and stated it felt as if i was not wearing a condom at all. I can also feel the extreme difference in comparison to other condoms. This one is very thin and diminish sensitivity very little. Since my first purchase tis is my 3 box with no breakages yet.\n", 
            "\n  After trying so many condoms I have finally found my go to. Please Trojan, do not stop making these and keep on making more.\n", 
            "\n  Much thinner then previous Magnums.  It's annoying though that I can't seem to find the Magnum XL anymore. These ones fit very tight and left a deep purple ring on my penis and as in sure most of you reading this are aware, these don't cover the entire length of the penis either.  If they made these a little longer/wider I feel like they would be my go to condom. Hopefully they'll see enough of us complaining and make the Magnum XL in a bare skin style.\n"

            "\n  I hate condoms.  Almost as much as I hate hormonal contraception.  However, with a two-year-old and a two-month-old at home, my husband positively refuses to come anywhere near me without one.  By luck, when I first went shopping for condoms a month ago, I purchased these.  They were AWESOME.  I decided condoms weren't so bad after all.  However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.  (Obviously, I'm new to this, so I wasn't up-to-speed yet on the differences between latex and lambskin condoms.)  There is simply no comparison.  I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.  They're worth every penny.  Just look at it this way:  You could purchase thousands of these, and they'd still be less expensive than a child.  :)\n", 
            "\n  After having our first baby, I didn't want to take any form of hormone contraception.  Unfortunately, traditional latex condoms were really uncomfortable for me.  We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)", 
            "We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.  I'm not aiming to get pregnant with a 6.5-month-old infant at home, and we are happy that these condoms have been the key to allowing my husband and me to keep the love-light burning.  :)", 
            "Edit:  After nearly four months of use, we've found that the condoms aren't all the same size.  Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.  They're a bit pricy (compared to latex), so that's unfortunate.  Even so, I definitely wouldn't let that stop me from buying another box!  They are definitely the best!\n", 
            "\n  Without a doubt these suckas keep my dude piston feeling all natural.  Latex just desensitizes the junk, while the skin-to-skin feels awesome!  Boom!  Nearest to wearing nothing, these jimmy hats are the Real Deal Holyfield!", 
            "Church\n", 
            "\n  My partner and I can hardly feel these at all. I gave up hormonal birth control entirely, and now use only these, and they have worked perfectly. They transmit all the heat and feeling, and you don't have the problem with friction that you do with latex condoms.", 
            "My advice: They are a little harder to roll into place, but you can be a little rough with them to tug them down - they've never broken on us. Remember to leave room at the tip, and that these DON'T protect against HIV or other STDs.\n", 
            "\n  It feels a bit odd rating this item, but I am doing so because someone needs to inform women about this product.  To be honest, I was extremely hesitant to try this product.  Husband and I are in our early forties and I have been informed by my physician to consider going off of birth control pills.  I was not open to having my tubes tied (nor the expense), nor did I want an IUD floating around inside me for years.  In addition, my husband was not open to having a vasectomy, as he is a physician and saw one too many men in his office w/difficulties from that procedure.  I ran across this Naturalamb product while shopping at a local pharmacy and took a stab at it.  For the record, my husband and I do not prefer to use condoms, but I took a stab at it and purchased a small box anyway.  Well, suffice it to say that neither I nor my husband have a single complaint about this product.  This product feels very, very natural.  I do  highly recommend.\n", 
            "\n  My vagina is basically allergic to everything. Almost everything sets off a yeast infection. I've tried every condom variation under the sun. Extra lube, no spermicide, non latex, lube free. These lamb skins do give me a slight reaction but it is by far the least bad reaction out of all the ones I've tried. I'll take that as a win.\n", 
            "\n  My wife wanted to stop taking the pill, since she's been on it for most of her life. I wasn't real crazy about the idea of using condoms, but it was definitely my turn to shoulder some of the contraceptive responsibility. After trying these condoms, I have no problem using them for the rest of my reproductive days. These are definitely the best condoms ever made- the truly feel like you aren't wearing one at all. That would be the one downside, if there are any. My wife and I have had a few moments where we weren't sure if the condom was still on because it felt so \"natural.\" As horrible as it sounds, I guess that's a good problem to have :)\n"

After trying several assortments, my FAVORITE is Durex Extra Sensitive.  I highly recommend them.  They are super thin and they are the closest thing to feeling like you are dipping your candle without one.  Knock on wood... I have never had not one rip or tear on me even with rough use.  Remember... I am talking about Durex Extra Sensitive Condoms, not this 2 starred one.\n"

            "\n  I've used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don't roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a \"choking\" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren't so damn tight. For reference I'm about 8.5\" long and 2\" wide (6.25\" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can't believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don't dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don't feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I'm guessing that's because they are the \"thin\" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you're not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I'd say if you're over about 7\" long or 6\" around (1.75\" wide) you should definitely give these a try.", 
            "FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn't have a single one rip, so I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I'm guessing since they're the \"thin\" version maybe if you don't have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.\n",

While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried.",

This may be a good alternative if worried about the condom staying securely in place and depending on your situation that might be a good thing.  However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4\" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.  Also, the Magnum Ecstasy version I tried had \"Warming and Tingling, Nonoxynol-9\" that left me feeling disconnected from the experience.",

Magnum is my brand because they don't strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should've been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn't enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it's a little snug at the base....It doesn't seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I'm not going to be the guy who says it feels like there's nothing on.  I mean, let's be honest:  If you're wearing a condom, sex isn't as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: \"Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.\"  I thought so as well.  It is definitely thinner, and to put it courteously, fun was had by all.  If you need to wear a larger condom and you actually want to feel like you're having sex with a woman, then this is your condom.\n"

Another sign that they were old is that the packaging has been redesigned and this was the old box.",

The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.",

The first thing I noticed, was this rolls on like a second skin. The fit is FANTASTIC! I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick. One partner reached multiple Oh's and described a very pleasurable experience with Lelo Hex. The sensations I felt allowed me to get where I wanted to go, too!",

It's not the same as going bareback but this is as close as I have found, very happy with these.\n", 
            "\n  These are awesome, ignore the lesbian that for some reason bought these. The condom is extra tight, which works great with the thin hexagonal latex. It seems the hexagons add friction so the condom is actually not moving during sex.\n",

My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.", 
            "So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.\n",

But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n",

            "I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.", 
            "Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.",

Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.\n", 
            "\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was \" Oh S***....Damn.\" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.\n", 
            "\n  Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.\n", 
            "\n  I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n", 
            "\n  I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.", 
            "On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.", 
            "My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.", 
            "Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.\n"

The bowl comes in a thin (and super jam packed) plastic bowl with four varieties of condoms (Natural Feeling, Pleasure Max, Extra Sensitive, Her Sensation. The picture is deceiving in that it shows a rainbow condom but that was not included in the bowl). I'm not a believer that the condom type makes a huge difference, so the variety didn't really matter to me, but in case you are, each condom is color coded and you can tell what type they are by the black print on the non-colored side of the condom.",

Yet when you get the package it's just 4 different types. Not really a variety being that there's a total of 144 so i would expect more of an assortment especially since that is what the picture and description displays to you. As you can see in the picture i only got 4 different  types and just my luck i got a huge amount of purple which happens to be our least favorite type of durex condom. Definitely a let down to now we got all excited for a variety and were sadly disappointed.\n",

You just snap it on, flip it over and BAM, done.  But no, it's filled with actual Durex condoms.  Not being the wasteful type, I feng shuied them around in there, added some water and now Carlos has a styling new bachelor pad.  No more awkward search of the nightstand when he has over a lady-Beta.  He is literally, and I mean literally, swimming in condoms.  All in all, not what I expected but a high quality product.\n",

            "\n  Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .  I personally wish they weren't colored but I know that most flavored condoms are. All of them expire at leat three years out from the date I ordered them.  Some don't expire for 4. We are very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying them again.  Though it will probably be a while before we need to!\n", 
            "\n  Whats going on Durex? I got my first bowl that didn't have a cover. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover. Despite there being a cover on all the pictures on Amazon. So lets call it what it really is a GAME OF 144 PICKUP. You even put it in one of the tipsiest shapes known to man the fishbowl. Maybe you figure many will be lost and you will have quicker reorders. Would the 2 cents for a cover break the bank at Durex?\n"

            "\n  The Okamoto 004 is the best overall Latex condom I have come across so far. It basically fits like a regular US condom while being thinner at 0.04. The few condoms in this range in the US such as the Trojan Bareskin and Durex Avanti Bare Latex at about 52mm were way too tight at the base ring. The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower. As of now in 2014 the main Latex condom I personally buy is the Okamoto 004.\n", 
            "\n  Nice quality condom. Very thin and comfortable. However, it runs small. watch out for the size. It got very tight wrapping on me. I don't know how this is going to fit others. But not the right fit for me. too small.\n", 
            "\n  Having used most variations of the popular brands (Trojans, Durex, and LifeStyle) in the US at one time or another this is far and away the best I've tried so far. It's incredibly thin and feels like there's almost nothing there and I've had no breakage issues.", 
            "I haven't tried any of the thinner Okamoto condoms yet since there were so many reviews about them breaking but am so impressed with these, I will. But I'll definitely be keeping a box of these and highly recommend them.\n", 
            "\n  I bought a few types of condoms to try something new with my bf. These are by far the best. They seem smoother, sturdier, and stretcher than Trojan Supras (although Supras transfer heat better). They are both thinner and transfer heat better than Sir Richard's ultra thins, skyn condoms, and playboy ultra thins.", 
            "These are by far the best I've ever tried. They don't smell and the lube doesn't irritate - like most durex and Trojans do.\n", 
            "\n  I've used Okamoto Crowns for years.  You can get them dirt cheap.  These are like 5-10x more expensive.  Was expecting to notice more of a difference.  This is a product I'm willing to pay more for if it feels better so I'll give 0.02s a shot.  If not, back to the Crowns.\n", 
            "\n  For the past few years I have been using  Kimonos and Crowns. I decided I would change it up and picked up a box of these. First thing I noticed was the packaging. These where very well packaged. Not that is matters. The fit was great, no funky plastic odors, and where very durable. My wife said they felt amazing, almost like I wasn't wearing one. So that's what really matters. I would recommend these. While they are a little pricey they are one of the best condoms I have ever tried.\n", 
            "\n  Have always enjoyed Okamoto products but these were nothing spectacular, and the lubricant irritated my girlfriend. Will not be repurchasing.\n", 
            "\n  They are thin, but that makes them great.  One broke, but it was my own fault.  Can't put that on the condom.\n"

            "I've never been a fan of Trojan. Every time I use them I feel very uncomfortable, like they never seem to fit right, or the specified \"effect\" or \"special lubricant\" or whatever never seems to stack up to their claims. To my knowledge i'm not allergic to latex but with trojan condoms I seem to display qualities of a latex allergy without any of the more unpleasant side effects (swelling, inflamation, ect).", 
            "Being that I didn't know if latex was the problem I decided for the hell of it to try something else and since lamb skin are less effective percentage wise, my friend recommended these to me about 5 years ago. After seeing a commercial I finally gave in and bought a bulk pack of like 12 or whatever, and I haven't bought another brand since.", 
            "Not only are they extremely comfortable (as far as these type of products go) but they really do simulate the sensation of \"wearing nothing\" better than any other product on the market. Application and removal is a breeze. no bunching, snagging, pinching or any of those unpleasant problems posed by thick latex style products. And best of all they stretch and conform without ever losing their seal. Fantastic product.\n", 
            "\n  I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction. As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.", 
            "One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you're ... y'know ... \"oversized,\" you might find these too tight. My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.\n", 
            "\n  Polyisoprene is extremely superior to latex in sensation and comfort, particularly in temperature transfer. Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice. Plus partners may be mildly irritated by latex and not be aware of it - using polyisoprene ensures a better chance of everyone having the best experience possible. Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.\n", 
            "\n  Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:", 
            "- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort.", 
            "- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation.",

            "- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too.",

I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback.

It is more pleasurable for both the male & female than traditional condoms; and offers more protection against STDS that can be spread by skin to skin contact by covering the outer area of the vagina. The ring that remains out of the vagina adds extra clitoral stimulation and friction during inner course. My boyfriend question if I was really wearing it the first time we used one, because it felt sooo good he couldn't tell. I love that I can put it in before we even begin to mess around - so there is no momentum lost fumbling around for a condom. Plus since they are non latex you can use any lube you want. They are big, which seemed weird at first glance- but once I tried them I was hooked.  I just wish local stores carried them.",

He is a bit larger, so they are more comfortable for him than regular condoms, and I like them for when I'm feeling extra sensitive and don't want quite as much stimulation. Also, the fact that they are nitrile instead of latex is a big plus.  I didn't think we would like these, but we very much do.\n",

I also use spermicide. The combo left me with a god awful smell but Id rather deal with a smell for a couple of days (even after bathing) than everything that can come from not using protection. I find that missionary position works best so you can hold on to the condom. Switching positions didn't work out too well. So for me, once you put it in and start a position, stay in that position if you can. The spermicidal lube really helped the feeling for my spouse. Good luck!\n",

            "\n  For a latex condom these aren't bad at all. They don't have a latex smell like some of the other brands (Durex and Trojan) do. They're pretty thin and very strong; however they're not as thin as the polyurethane condoms (Sagami) that I have been using the last year and half. Would I recommend these? Sure, for someone wanting an inexpensive yet reliable latex condom they're pretty good. As far as size goes; I'm average in width (55mm) and length; I guess I'm used to using polyurethane condoms that don't stretch and fit snug; something I was hoping would also be the case with these. The base of these holds pretty tight and the shaft is pretty close, but they stretch ALOT and don't hold tight quite like the poly condoms do that dont stretch. These came packaged lose inside a plastic mailing bag; they were doubled (two condoms) per piece; labeled not for retail sale. I was actually surprised to see these as in my mailbox because I had canceled my order; yet someone at CS must have made a mistake and sent them anyway. I'm not complaining, getting a bag chocked full of condoms for free isn't a bad deal. The dates were good till 2020; I opened three of them to see what they looked and felt like and all were nice silky smooth in texture and had no smell.\n",

Luckily the ring base is tight enough that we haven't had one come off, but if you pull out to change positions, you'll notice that it eventually starts to look like you maybe tried to slip on a condom that's a bit too big for you. They get the job done, but you and your partner deserve better.\n",

I think the Durex are a little thinner, but the LifeStyles are better lubricated. Both of these are noticeably thinner than everything else we've tried. We use some lube anyway so it was pretty much a tie. I looked up condoms on Consumer Reports and found that the LifeStyles ULTRA SENSITIVE made a perfect score! That's why I ended up going with these. Hard to argue with science and you certainly can't beat this price.\n",

            "\n  This is I and my husbands favorite condom for pregnancy prevention! Easy to use, fit is good, transfers heat faster, and way more comfortable for both of us because it is not stiff/rubbery like the others. Comes with great instructions if that is a plus for anyone :) Not sure why people make a big deal out of the smell. I can't even tell unless I put it right up to my nose and even then it is very mild. Highly recommend for you to try! It is way cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I can find. We bought a pack of three at Walgreens to try them before we bought the big pack. The pack of 3 at Walgreens cost over 15 dollars! I couldn't believe it! Over 5 bucks per condom, and just over 2 dollars on Amazon. Thanks for the great product at a great deal!\n", 
            "\n  i gave this a 5 star rating because it allows the user the most pleasurable sensation a condom can ever produce.  It is, by far, the most quality Condom because you actually feel like you do not have a Condom on at all.  And would especially recommend it to those who find orgasm quite difficult with other, more thicker Condoms.\n", 
            "\n  Having 3 kids, 1 of which is 6 weeks old my wife and I are in no hurry for another one. We have looked at tons of options but I don't want a vasectomy and neither of us wants her on some jacked up pharmaceutical conconction to prevent birth so we opted for condoms. Disafisfied by how they feel we have tried a ton of them and settled on Skyn because I thought that was as good as it could get. After doing a bit of research online I found these and thought I would give them a try so I went to my local CVS to buy a 3 pack just to give them a go before buying in bulk. We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price. I will never go back to regular condoms. Doesn't protect against STDs but you shouldnt be out screwing some random chick anyways. Take it from someone who has lived both scenes. Married sex is way better than random sex. Hands down.\n",

The box was open and had no plastic wrap on the box. I chose to ignore it and opened the box to find that there were no \"pleasure pack\" condoms and they had been replaced with normal trojan condoms. All condoms were the same color as opposed to how they should have been (4 different types and colors). I trashed them because I was scared who might have touched them.\n",

They are Trojan and they do the job( or at least they have so far) But I would beware you aren't going to get fire and Ice in them.\n",

            "Here's my review, first off, I didn't purchase from Amazon. I got it from condomdepot .com. I purchased a 24 pack ($9.99), googled for a discount, found one at 12% off, and used the free priority shipping.  It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk. I searched for the best price before I purchased, even looked here, and I felt the price there was already pretty good, add the free shipping and the discount and my mine was made.", 
            "Now as far as use goes, I thought the condom looked smaller than other condoms, but it slipped right on my sweetie with no problems. I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything. I got these condoms for HIM, because I wanted us to be protected but I wanted him to be able to feel as much as possible. I also noticed that there was no latex and sex smell after we were done.",

            "\n  It feels like nothing's there because it probably broke. I've never had a condom break on me until now. I only purchased this laughably because I wanted to try something new and the reviews were great. If you're not ready to bring new life into this world because you have toys to buy and places to see...stick to Trojan or Durex.\n", 
            "\n  These are great condoms for the price. Between my wife and I, we go through a lot of them and I love being able to buy these in bulk. I have never had one burst on me. The lubrication is not that great so make sure you have some good lube on hand.\n", 
            "\n  Amazon has the best cheapest price on these condoms. I love the feel of them. They fit well and they don't smell like some condoms do. I'm always buying this brand whenever I run out. This is the cheaper version to those condoms that are like .002 or .003 or .004 sizes.\n", 
            "\n  If you have a lot of sex, condoms can get costly. These are only a fraction of the costs of the big name manufacturers and work just as well. I moved away from Trojans because they always felt too thick and gave off a bad smell. Durex was my preferred brand but they got more and more expensive. These feel thinner than both brands (which I worry about) but I have yet to have one fail on me.\n", 
            "\n  These used to be my favorite condoms. Either I've changed or they have but these used to be a perfect fit and now they're too snug, too stiff, and overall, just not comfortable to wear. Go get free condoms somewhere. Don't waste your money on awful, uncomfortable condoms.\n", 
            "\n  I don't want to unnecessarily scare anyone, but my husband and I had used more expensive name-brand condoms (Trojan and Durex) for the past 7 years with complete success.  Within a month of switching to these, one broke.  I'm currently 11 weeks pregnant.  Could it have been a coincidence?  Yes.  Could another brand of condom have broken?  Of course.  And I'm excited for the new baby and all...but I will NOT be relying on these again in the future.\n"

            "\n  As a woman, these are my favorite condoms for a partner to wear. The design of them is best suited for someone with a bigger girth, otherwise they'll feel 'loose' as some reviewers mention. I never had a problem with breakage. The best of Trojan brand - I love them so much, I'm having a friend bring me more as they're not sold in London (where I currently reside). Durex has nothing comparable.\n", 
            "\n  Most people will see the thickness and be turned off but there is a trick to getting the most out of this condom. Try unrolling it a bit before putting it on. Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you. This will create friction inside and friction is feeling. With a normal condom you have to rely on stretching to create this friction. The tapered end should hold securely onto the base (if your sized right), but I would test things out solo to make sure there are no surprises.\n",

            "\n  After trying many others options I arrived at these many years ago and I haven't used anything else since. That said I feel very confident that these are genuine and of the same great quality I've come to expect from Lifestyles. I generally need a larger condom and the comfort tip on these accommodate that nicely. They're thin enough that they're not restrictive and though they fit me a little more on the snug side I've been loyal to this brand/style for over ten years and I've yet to break one which is more than I can say for many of the others I've tried. They're offered here at a great value and if you're an average or larger man I'd recommend these!", 
            "If you're on the smaller side, I'd recommend you try something different as I imagine these might be a struggle to keep on for smaller guys because of the combination of them being on the thinner side and the comfort tip.\n", 
            "\n  After years of trying, and failing, to have kids, we stopped worrying about birth control.  Then our daughter surprised us last year.  Now we have to worry about it for the first time in 12+ years.  Condoms never bothered me when I was younger.  Now that I'm older, and haven't had to wear one in forever, they don't seem as comfortable.  These are okay.  Do what they need to do.  I certainly wouldn't consider them to be \"Ultra Sensitive\" or anything special.  I do know that I always preferred LifeStyles back in the day.\n", 
            "\n  Never been satisfied with any condoms from companies other than Trojan. Since LifeStyles condoms were best sellers at Walmart with a great price. So, gave it a try, and loved them.", 
            "As for this product, it's good and all but they do not come packaged in the proper box. 50 of these were packaged nicely in a plastic bag. I do not have any complaints but just an FYI.\n", 
            "\n  Even though i hate  having to use them  these are the best i have used , forget the cheap imposters trust me  buy these condoms they feel great putting them on and when they are put in no great loss of sensation.\n", 
            "\n  DO NOT USE! These condoms lack lubrication and have come off 3 times during intercourse in the past year, lodging themselves deep inside my partner's vagina. At first we thought this was the result of human error, but then we realized it only happened with this specific condom. I have never had a similar incident in many years of sex with all different brands and models of condoms, and neither has my partner. This is a highly ineffective -- not to mention dangerous -- product!\n", 
            "\n  Good value but the damn things came with an invoice that says \"Chubby Dick Emporium.\" This was an embarrassing surprise, as they arrived in a padded envelope at work and the receptionist opened the envelope and pulled the invoice before realizing it was a \"personal\".\n", 
            "\n  I received a few of these during the LGBT Pride Parade of 2016 in New York City, and the Ultra Sensitive Condoms have proven to be durable and well-lubricated. While it almost feels like you are not wearing a condom, it is difficult to tear these. Highly recommended.\n", 
            "\n  fast shipping ..everything was intact and the product itself works good and is comfortable.. the price was very good and definitely would buy again.\n"

            "\n  Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!\n", 
            "\n  Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.  Some other reviews have said that the lotion is too effective but I found it to work perfectly for my needs.  I guess the only way to know for each person is to try it out for yourself.\n", 
            "\n  I was kinda nervous about putting that chemical on my penis but it wasn't that bad like other reviews say. Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.\n", 
            "\n  This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, \"Do you need it?\"", 
            "In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).", 
            "For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don't already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn't recommend that you use these.  You might find out the \"hard?\" way that you don't really need any extra help.\n", 
            "\n  Never had condoms break before I've tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same \"procedure\", \"preparation\", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.\n", 
            "\n  Good condom brand. I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!\n", 
            "\n  I picked these ones because of the amazon coupon you can clip but I'm glad I did.", 
            "The dots and ribs ad lots of pleasure for her and honestly these are the best quality condoms I've ever used, these things stretch like crazy without breaking.", 
            "Definitely recommend!\n", 
            "\n  Every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it. I have to remove that hard solid stuff to make sure I would not get hurt by this silly condom.\n"

The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9\".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don't seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don't have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you're rolling in the dough.",

These are the only condoms that I don't mind putting on.  Let's just say that it can get very dangerous if you're coming up with excuses to not put on a jimmy hat because you don't like the feel.

For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers. For now for the times I use polyurethane condoms I will use the Okamoto 002 Large that fit closer to a regular condom because for me the base ring was too tight on these Sagami 002 Original.\n", 
            "\n  These are great, a little bit tighter than what I am used to (normally use skyn or supra). Had to check and make sure it was still there a few times, not a bad thing. Work very well and I will certainly be buying more. I really want to try the .01, but I have only seen them in the smaller size which I don't think will work out for me.\n", 
            "\n  Compared to wearing condoms off the self, the Sagami 002 is far superior. While I have yet to try the applauded Sagami 001, this condom comes in a larger pack, which was a decided factor in my purchase.\n", 
            "\n  Wondrous joy! Thinnest condom on the market (though I've heard of the elusive 0.01mm, but cannot find it)! Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)", 
            "Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...", 
            "If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2\" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir. I've read that these condoms are ~1.4\" girth, but up to 2\", you'll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don't work out for you.\n", 
            "\n  The best condoms out there! I have tried A LOT of different brands over the years and I can say hands down, this gives the most natural feel. Really does seem like there's nothing there. This is a VERY close next best thing to nothing at all!\n", 
            "\n  my Husband loves these condoms. He says they're the thinnest condom he's tried. Quite tight, so they're sometimes tricky to get on. Definitey prefer it without, of course, but we don't want any more kids for a while, and I don't like birth control. Anyway, definitely our favorite condom!\n"

That's where LifeStyles \"Snugger fit\" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up \"averages\" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?

            "\n  The only reason I ever ordered these condoms was because my girlfriend has a latex allergy. I figured they'd be lame because A) condoms are annoying to begin with, and B) if good condoms could be made from something other than latex, than why is latex the de facto standard for like every condom in the universe?", 
            "Well, I still don't know the answer to B), but after going through a box of Skyn condoms, I can honestly say that I would use them even if my partner weren't allergic to latex. They feel significantly better than the condoms I've used in the past (Trojans), and they're reliable. As a bonus, buying them here is vastly cheaper, more convenient, and less embarrassing than buying them at Walgreen's. I'd recommend this product to anyone who relies on condoms for birth control with a significant other, latex allergy or not.", 
            "When I ordered a second box, the seller accidentally put the wrong item in the package. The packing slip showed the correct order, but instead of 50 Skyn condoms there were 50 Snugger Fit condoms, which are made from latex. I contacted the seller through Amazon, explained that the latex condoms were useless to me because of my girlfriend's latex allergy, and requested that the correct item be sent to me as soon as possible.", 
            "My complaint was filed on Monday night. On Tuesday morning I had a response from the seller, who apologized for the error and said that the correct item was on its way. On Wednesday morning the correct condoms were on my doorstep via Fed Ex. Although I was pretty annoyed when I got the wrong item in the package, the seller's blistering fast customer service and immediate correction have left me with an even higher esteem for the folks who make these condoms.\n",

Don't listen, Im 7 1/2 and close to two inches in diameter and these roll almost all the way down to the base and don't feel too tight. I don't get the \"plastic bag\" sensation with these.  Ive found normal trojans to be too tight and went with the larger size. These however fit wonderfully. very comfortable, no slippage, almost no odor and they transmit heat well. I really like that they are not slathered in lubricant as well. there is some but not too much.\n", 
            "\n  I've used over 100 of these (years before their expiration dates) and have never had one break. They work very well for my latex allergy. The seller \"Chubby Dick Emporium\" also delivered in less than a week with free shipping, and provided 4+ years before expiration.\n", 
            "\n  these are my favorite condoms just as polyisoprene medical procedure gloves are far superior to latex gloves. silky, buttery smooth. they trounce the \"\u00fcber-thin\" latex ones I was using before bc they just feel so warm and smooth.\n", 
            "\n  Really impressed with these condoms. Have not used them in nearly a decade so when it came time to pick them up again i was dreading a bit. This is a whole new generation of condom. Sensation is actually pretty good and they fit very well. Love the fact that they've got lube but they're not slathered. that's a huge plus\n", 
            "\n  First of all, do yourself a favor and stop using cheap latex condoms...... THESE ARE AMAZING. Everyone knows using condoms sucks, but they are necessary sometimes. These don't chafe, smell weird, or cause irritation and the price is unbelievable. I barely notice these when using and neither does my boyfriend. I will be purchasing again.\n", 
            "\n  I don't typically review my items, but I can't not explain how great these are. Like others here, I bought these condoms because the girl I am seeing is very allergic to latex.

No odor, been through about 200 of then so far without a single hiccup, and no more balloons!!!!!!!", 
            "I would recommend this condom to anyone who needs to stay away from latex. I also encourage people who don't need to stay away from latex to buy a pack of 3 to at least try them out. Terrific condoms, 5/5\n"

            "\n  If you like to make sweet love, but would rather not make babies, then this product is for you!  Somehow, they have created this amazing product and I have to say, it really works!  No matter how many times I have sex, these things keep the baby magic from happening!  Great product!", 
            "Hopefully they'll make a product that will keep me from getting fat when I'm eating Ice Cream!  That would be awesome!\n",

            "Quite frankly, I hate condoms.  I think most guys do.  As it so happens, I hate babies, rashes, burning sensations, and incurable diseases even more than condoms.  So it's a necessary evil.  Nonetheless, I hate condoms to the extent where just opening the wrapper made Senor Johnson go back to sleep almost instantaneously.", 
            "But Senor Johnson approves of these.  They're so thin that you'd think they'd tear easily, but I've never had one of these fail in my life.  They're well lubed without leaving you sliding all over the place, and they don't have that noxious smell that gets progressively worse as bodily fluids get involved.  These are as inoffensive as condoms get.", 
            "The only problem with them is that they're a bit tight, even by average standards.  For average Joes, that might be a good thing since it's absolutely impossible to slip out of these unless Senor Johnson passes out.  But if your Senor Johnson is pornstar tier, these might feel more like a mechanical vice than a condom.  So if you have that problem, god bless you and look elsewhere.",

            "As for a specific box of these condoms:", 
            "The box I received was in pristine condition, however they can be damaged along the way. My experience tells me that if handled properly, these condoms are very reliable. As always, check the box and individual wrappers before using.", 
            "Have fun.\n", 
            "\n  I'm always looking for a better condom, but I haven't found one yet. I will continue to try new condoms but so far I always end up coming back to these. Great sensation, easy to put on and they don't dry up quickly. I can't give a condom 5 stars though because it's still a condom.\n", 
            "\n  My Partner and I both agree that these condoms feel much better than Trojans, And Lifestyles. Mainly because of its extremely thin properties, and proper lubrication. We've used over 100 and have been quite satisfied with the results, we would recommend this product to anyone sexually active and want something better than trojans, and lifestyles.\n", 
            "\n  So I ordered on 2 occasions. First time was sold by QUIVERR in January.  Package was immaculate.  3 Boxes 12 each shrink wrapped. Not expiring any time soon. Second time sold by RYMATT WELLNESS LLC package came in big zip lock bag with 3 individual smaller bags of 12.  So 50/50 on the wrapping issue that people talking about.  I opened right away and looked for any holes or any signs of tampering and expiration date of 2020.  I can't see any defects.  I'll let you know in a couple of months! {nervous laughter}\n", 
            "\n  This is a very good and reliable product. It is the closest thing to using nothing I've been able to find.\n", 
            "\n  I love these condoms; no babies have resulted from their  use!  Also, they do not attenuate any sensations, enabling a very happy ending.  There's an option to add a photo, but why would I show a picture of my bathroom's garbage can?\n"

All styles are lubricated. I was quite pleased to see brands that I recognize and honestly like using and frequently buy: Beyond Seven is a good condom brand in my opinion so I am happy that I got them.

We especially liked the variety to choose from. The silver box they come in is so discreet and also very useful because boxes always rip or the condoms are falling out everywhere. Not really helpful if you are trying to hide them from kids. haha!\n", 
            "\n  Needed a form of birth control after my son was born that wouldn't effect lactation with hormones...condoms are the simplest choice. My husband was buying these at the store in three packs for a huge markup. I told him I'm too cheap to pay $2 every time we want to use one when there are less expensive options...so I got on Amazon to see the price difference and buy in bulk...so glad I did. These work well, I honestly don't feel much difference between types, my husband says the thinner the better. He has always liked the durex brand best so we stick with it.",

I mean, I try to be chemical free in everything else, so after a little thought, I decided to opt for a latex condom without chemical lubricants and dyes and fragrance. You can buy these on Amazon too, they are called sustain condoms. They are beautifully packaged, natural and vegan...I'm not vegan, but appreciate the qualifications a vegan product must have...if the chemical load of conventional condoms gets to you too, maybe durex isn't for you either.\n",

The \"flavored\" condoms do have a taste! which surprised me because I've tried another flavored brand and it was nothing much but a scent and no taste. But these do and my girlfriend noticed and enjoyed it for a bit, the taste doesn't last but its better than it just being scented.\n",

We personally prefered the SKYN brand ones, he said it almost felt like he was wearing nothing. The Durex brand had great lubrication and is our second choice although they're a bit tight. The Trojan ones were really too small and very tight and I don't think very well lubricated. I would absolutely recommend this product if you are trying out condoms, it's a lot cheaper than buying an entire box of something you may not like or doesn't fit well. It was extremely helpful for us to be able to compare the different brands and see what would work best for us.

Perhaps because I'm also a little larger, so the comment that said it's a \"trash bag\" is more about sizing than anything else.  Great for bigger guys, there's room and it is tapered at the bottom so it stayed on great.\n", 
            "\n  My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.\n",

            "Size:", 
            "I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.", 
            "Shape:", 
            "They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.", 
            "Lube:", 
            "The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.\n", 
            "\n  If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the \"ribbing\" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I've ever encountered.  Frigging' Yuck.\n", 
            "\n  These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.\n", 
            "\n  Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.\n"

In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row.

            "The crown is comfortable, if a little snug for most men. It's also relatively thin, along the lines of .0042 thickness, if I recall correctly. You can get .002 and .002 thickness with other Japanese brands, however the price increases exponentially and the availability decreases as well. Crown is a wonderful go-between, but do be careful regarding the manufacturing locations.", 
            "Many years ago I purchased them when they were the original silver and blue packaging. They were thin and barely felt like they were there. These new blue and white packets feel thicker to me for some reason, though it could be because I went for a period without the need for condoms, and now that things have changed, it's hard adapting back to the ole latex.", 
            "I've used MANY of these condoms and have not had one failure. They are only lightly lubricated so make sure things are good to go before going at it or you'll create some heavy friction that's unpleasant for your partner (and bad for the latex). Very little smell on these, which is great, and the pink color almost makes it look invisible, which is another bonus.", 
            "I am getting used to these, and have almost finished my current 50 pack. If you're a Durex or generic store-brand user, you owe it to yourself to give the Crowns a shot. They will literally blow your mind.\n"

If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand.

So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.\n",

Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.

I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.",

On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India.

I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these \"plastic condoms\" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, \"this is the kind you have to use,\" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.\n"

            "\n  These condoms are great I just wish that they made a smaller size, embarrassing as it is, this condom is still a bit loose, not as bad as life styles snugger fit though! Over all I'd recommend to anyone with a smaller than average dick.\n", 
            "\n  This is a condom made for those of us who are on the smaller end of the size spectrum.  They are a bit shorter in length than most condoms and a lot snugger. The condoms found in most stores are around 53mm wide, these are 49mm wide; the 4mm difference is very noticeable.  If you're one of us that has been frustrated with slippage, BUY THESE!!! you might even find them too tight so I'd recommend getting the 12 count to make sure these are for you.  A lot of folks consider these the snuggest condoms on the market.  I also find the excess length of these on me acts as c-ring, which adds to my pleasure by prolonging climax.  For those of us on the short end of things, these are an awesome choice; good tight fit, lower price and peace of mind when used.  It's been so awesome to not have to worry about these slipping off, allows for sex to be about pleasing my wife and me.\n", 
            "\n  these are great, both my wife and i enjoyed these much better than regular condoms. She had more pleasure from them than me. She said it was almost like I was not wearing a condom and to her felt almost as natural as not wearing one. No slippage at all and it is really a snug fit. For me it did feel really nice and the snug fit felt good and helped stay erect for a little bit longer.\n", 
            "\n  Bought these to keep in various places, they were extremely tight on me to the point that it felt like a cock ring. They did however stretch very well and was amazed. I am 50/50 because sometimes it does make he harder since it feels like a cockring and other times it feels weird and I have to switch back to normal sized condoms.\n", 
            "\n  They arrived the earliest day as expected and the condoms were well within their experation date 2021-1-05. I wish they packaged them a bit more professionally but overall I am happy with the product. I like how secure this condom is, never slips or breaks and fits well for those with a smaller girth.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms are perfect for those of us with smaller girth; it fits so snug that the base ring can act like an elastic ring which keeps things... solid!", 
            "For the price these are a great deal and will be purchasing from thus seller regularly. Well, regularly depending on my luck!\n", 
            "\n  If you've ever been paranoid about slippage during your performance or especially on your your exit, have no fear, caution wear is here!", 
            "Everyone's not built the same size and shape, but so far this is the most comfortable and worry free product I've used. It let's me enjoy getting back to my work than worrying about holding anything or re-adjusting.", 
            "Still, hold upon exit. You never know how much vacuum you'll be working against. But it makes everything feel safer.\n", 
            "\n  The smallest condom I've come across (no pun intended). Tight fit, perhaps too much so for me because I'm short in length but average in thickness. So it was a little too tight.\n"

I don't know if my case is different then most people, but I dealt with a severe illness for the last 18 years of my life (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). For anyone not familiar with that illness...you basically feel like you have a severe case of the flu every day, which includes full body muscle aches and pain along with brain fog, poor sleep, non existent sex drive, no energy...and just an overall feeling of frustration.",

After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it. I'm so glad that I made the choice that I did. I was so surprised by the results I just have to get another bottle to keep that feeling going. It made me feel like I did when I was young.",

            "\n  After years of not using condoms because my wife was on birth control. I thought that the thinner the condom was, the better it would make me feel. I'm a little above average in size. About 6.5-7in. So we tried a whole lot of them. And I found out that I needed ones like these, with lubricant on the inside and outside. And the extra space around the shaft creates the closest feeling to not using one at all. And my wife feels the same way about them. This became our favorite condom line from the very first use!\n", 
            "\n  I see some comments saying that the condom is too baggy but it fits me just fine. Just like shoes you have to find the ones that fit you best. The new style Trojan is doing does feel more comfortable than the traditional condom.\n", 
            "\n  A somewhat larger condom that feels good (for a condom), and the lady finds it comfortable.", 
            "The silicone (?) lubricant seems to work well.  There's a noticeable latex-y smell. It allows for some movement inside the latex (a feature, according to the product description), which might feel a little strange if you're coming from the more tightly fitted Trojan \"Ultra Thin\" series.  Both this \"Her Pleasure\" and the \"Ultra Thin\" are better quality and more comfortable for the lady than the cheaper Durex brand we've also tried.",

I'm around 6 inches and moderately thick, but these are obviously made for someone with a 7+ inch beer bottle girth dong. If I wanted a huge condom I would have bought the damn magnums.\n", 
            "\n  I've tried multiple varieties and brands, but this one gets the stamp of approval from multiple partners and me! For me, it feels like nothing's there. For them, it feels a bit roomier and comfortable than the average condom. Only buying these from now on.\n",

The great thing is I bought from a seller on here and they were selling it less than the official website and shipping was more affordable too! It worked out quite nicely buying from Amazon! The pleasure dots are just for me and my man doesn't mind one bit. The dots are a nice extra special treat for me. I love them!\n",

The sensitive ones suddenly become super sensitive.  My favorite actually turned out to be the glow in the dark one.  And yes it does work.  open it up first let it collect a little room light while you give your lady a little moonlight. wink wink.  Then strap on.  The small fit does some...lets say extending of time.  And the glow in the dark is actually a little thicker so not quite as sensitive.

This sample is perfect for figuring out which \"One\" is the the \"One\" for you!\n",

Perhaps because I'm also a little larger, so the comment that said it's a \"trash bag\" is more about sizing than anything else.  Great for bigger guys, there's room and it is tapered at the bottom so it stayed on great.\n", 
            "\n  My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.\n",

            "Shape:", 
            "They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.", 
            "Lube:", 
            "The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.\n",

They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.\n",

I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.\n"

My wife says that she hardly feels them (which is great). I on the other hand, can feel the difference between having it on and not having it on for sure, but that comes with the use of any condom. I love that they feel great for a condom, fit well, and very affordable (36 ct for $7.99?!... insanely cheap). Only complaint... should be more lubricated, but that can be fixed easily.

            "\n  While the picture shows a blue cover, the ones that arrived had the more standard silver cover.  Amazon seems to sell them for slightly more than the other vendor, but on something like this I don't mind spending a few bucks extra for the peace of mind that comes from knowing the retailer.", 
            "These are outstanding condoms.  Thin but strong.  Easy to use.  Fit comfortably.  A lot of people think they provide the best sensation on the market.  In that context, I would rate them way higher than anything made by Trojan, Lifestyles and other better-known manufacturers.  Frankly, I think marketing and distribution are probably the only reason these aren't as well known as Trojans.  I would never use a different type/brand.\n", 
            "\n  After nearly a decade of using Okamoto Crown condoms exclusively, my husband and I are sad to say that we're going to have to find another brand.  Ordinarily, and regardless of whether or not they were manufactured in Thailand, these condoms had almost no discernible odor and didn't cause any irritation for either one of us.", 
            "The condoms in the last pack we purchased smelled like a pile of burning tires.  Not only that, but they also caused quite a bit of swelling and irritation.  The lot number and expiration date were E15/T3Z4 and 11/2019, respectively.  The only reason I'm divulging this particular information is because I'd be very curious to know whether or not others have noticed this change or we simply got a bad batch.", 
            "Either way, we have to begin the search for a new brand of condom, preferably one that doesn't smell like burning rubber or cause the sort of irritation these now cause.\n", 
            "\n  This gets 1 star because it's not thecrown condoms you would expect.", 
            "These are not the same Crown condoms that are made in Japan. These ones are made in Thailand. What's the difference? These Thailand manufactured condoms smell strongly of rubber and have very little lube! I'm just warning any of you who have read great reviews on these, because the ones made in Japan are actually really great. These Thailand condoms are cheap and stinky.", 
            "To be fair, the fit seems to be roughly the same (feels a bit tighter) and my girlfriend and I used one when we ran out of good condoms (durex super thin extra sensitive condoms) and it wasn't awful minus the really disgusting smell (major turn off). The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)", 
            "Definitely go with the Durex extra sensitive on this one. They are a bit wider, they are just as thin as the Crown Skinless Skin, they have NO smell or taste, are lubed generously, and I've used hundreds of them with no breaks.\n", 
            "\n  These just arrived and I haven't used them yet so this review is more to inform people about something that surprised me. Never having ordered this kind of thing in bulk, I assumed they'd come in a large Costco-style Okamoto/Crown box, or retail packaging of some kind. Instead they came in a plastic bag. It definitely weirded me out at first. When I thought about it I realized of course if you're buying them in bulk they'll arrive that way, it just startled me when I first saw it. All of these condoms appear to expire in 2017 so I have plenty of time to go through them. I will update once I've had the chance to use them (though god only knows when that will be *sigh*).\n", 
            "\n  Made in Japan! What I thought these didn't exist anymore. The word on the street is that the ones made in Thailand aren't as good. Although I can't verify that because this is my first purchase. These condoms are awesome! Unfortunately though, I've only been able to use one in two weeks. \ud83d\ude2d What the H!  At this rate they'll last forever. Maybe I'll just try them on for fun. Oh - I could learn how to tie balloon animals.\n", 
            "\n  The condom is true to its name. Really feels like nothing is there. Also they are very inexpensive (100pk for 15 dollars) one thing to remember is that as stated on the label it is lightly lubricated. So it's best to apply some extra especially if you plan on going for more then 10 mins. Another thing if you have more girth or length then average you will realize that it can be a snug condom. I personally felt like it didn't roll down close enough to my base a problem I haven't had with any other condom\n", 
            "\n  ...nothing at all...nothing at all! Pretty solid condom except for the fact that unless you get the girl wet enough, there will be some friction due to a lack of lubrication on these condoms. Other than that, they're pretty good.\n", 
            "\n  They are not kidding about these being thin; they are as \"barely there\" as any condom I've used (not that many now that I think about it).  Purchased in bulk for use with toys I share with my partner; if you do the same, just treat them with care when applying and they hold up pretty well.  Non-distinct taste for me.\n"

We were hesitant about this brand at first because before I went on the pill we tried so many different brands and there was such a loss of feeling to them, a lot of times he couldn't keep an erection while wearing one. But with this brand, it truly is the closest thing to wearing nothing! It's amazing how much better it feels than a regular condom. We only buy these and Lifestyle Skyn condoms now. They are the two best brands on the market if your partner has trouble keeping an erection with a normal condom. Also, we have never had one break so they seem to work just as well.

Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.",

Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.",

If you are a guy who loves to raw dog but always feels bad or scared after you hit it with no jimmy, then these are for you.  Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.  I hit the skins at least 4 times a week and I could practically be a spokesperson for these Jimmy's because I've used them so much.\n",

I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.", 
            "In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the \"S\" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says \"TM\" and the other \"R\". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India. Can I get answers as to whether they are counterfeit or real?",

            "\n  I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these \"plastic condoms\" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, \"this is the kind you have to use,\" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.\n"

My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.", 
            "So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.\n",

But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n",

Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.",

            "\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was \" Oh S***....Damn.\" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.\n",

I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n",

If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to \"size up\" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.\n", 
            "\n  excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.\n", 
            "\n  My boyfriend and I are very happy with these condoms. He doesn't feel choked and I can hardly feel them. No issues at the moment. If your man is larger than most go with these. Best purchase I made in awhile\n",

My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.", 
            "So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.\n",

But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n",

Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.",

Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was \" Oh S***....Damn.\" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.\n",

            "\n  No joke, great condoms.  I have tried the Durex, Lifestyles and many many other brands of rubbers over the last 16 yrs or so.  These are very good, and will feel like your condom broke, but they never do.... super strong.", 
            "Pro", 
            "Great feeling,", 
            "Super tight fit, so no accidental pull off", 
            "Fits all sizes, I am on the very large girth size and use large condoms because of this, but these even in regular are super tight, and add to the don't feel like I'm using them feeling,", 
            "No smell", 
            "Heat transfer.... you will feel all the heat and sensation you lose with latex.", 
            "Cons:", 
            "Need lube for these, seem to be without lube, even though they are lubed, if issue get lube or use the extra lube ones.", 
            "Can be tough to put on, take your time and because they are rolled so tight, make sure you check to see if its rolled under its self this will cause it to stop rolling down, just roll up a little and back down, or use lube before you start rolling.", 
            "Super tight can because of this can cause 1. super sensitivity and will make you finish faster, 2. must pinch tip, because condom will not move during sex, and this can cause issues when finishing up.", 
            "Over all one of my favorites in condoms.  Love how they feel, love the fact that they don't move during sex, and use these over latex anytime.  This and the fact that they are SUPER strong,and if you have allergies these are a MUST in any brand.\n", 
            "\n  If they fit for you, they're the best non-latex condom you can get.  Polyurethane doesn't have much stretch so they're going to feel a bit tighter; that said, the feeling is a lot better.  I'd say if your member is on the low range of the suggested size for a Trojan magnum, then that's the maximum size then these will fit for you comfortably.", 
            "The good: It's probably the closest to not wearing a condom feel you can get.  This was an issue the first few times I used them because I thought it slipped off.  I've never had an issue with slippage though.  Heat transfer is great.  It's thin so you'll feel a lot more.", 
            "The bad: They don't roll incredibly easy compared to other condoms.  Practice with one before the first time you're with your partner to save some embarrassment.  I also wish there was a better reservoir tip; breakage hasn't been an issue but a better tip would be nice.  They are tight due to being polyurethane; it's really a personal preference if they're too tight for you.", 
            "If you're in the market for a non-latex condom your two best options are these and Lifestyles Skyn.  I recommend trying both to see which work better for you.\n", 
            "\n  I have interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and vulvar vestibulitis, all of which make me very sensitive to condoms and lubricants. While I do not have a latex allergy, I find that latex condoms irritate my conditions. Additionally, I typically can't tolerate the lubricants that come on condoms, but I could not find a non-latex, non-lubricated condom. After doing some research, I discovered that polyurethane condoms are superior to polyisoprene because they can conduct temperature better and are thinner. I decided to give these a try despite the lubricant and found that I tolerate them very well. My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to \"bare back\" sex than any other condom and I don't have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI's afterward. Also, I can use non-water based lubricants that I find more effective and gentle and not worry about compromising the integrity of the condom. We won't use any other condom now.\n", 
            "\n  yay! no kids yet!", 
            "Aside from that this is as good as it gets.  I've tried many brands and types, this is the one for me.  It's more expensive than latex but it also feels WAY better and doesn't have that horrid latex smell.  There is no smell that comes from using these.\n", 
            "\n  im allergic to latex so finding a decent priced condoms are sometimes hard to come around. these are decently priced and they actually feel nice when using them. NO MORE KIDS lol that's all we really want in our marriage. we did find that you do need extra lube. they are pre lubed, but it wears off fast so extra is needed.\n", 
            "\n  Well trojan is the best condom brand there is. But my wife has to have latex free and there are ultra thin. \ud83d\ude09 So that's a plus. Fast shipping good care in the shipping. Five stars.\n", 
            "\n  Great alternative for people with a latex allergy (both you or your lover).  Nothing will beat the feel of latex, but at least this way you do more than complain about your allergy.  I agree with other reviewers that these are a tight fit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Better tight than loose.  Anyway, good price and product, prompt delivery and good communication.\n", 
            "\n  Having an allergy to latex, I have found these to be one of the better non-latex condoms.  I was a little leery buying these as some of the other reviews were not all that favorable.",

            "\n  These are absolutely fantastic condoms.  It isn't the size that matters, it's how you use it - but you can't use it if you don't get a good fit with protection!  That's where LifeStyles \"Snugger fit\" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up \"averages\" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?  It infuriates me that they don't carry these in stores.  Not everybody has a porn star penis.  Get real.",

            "\n  As a girl, I have always found thicker condoms to cause irritation during/after use. Well... while using Aoni with my partner, it was so thin that I forgot it was even there. Nothing comes close to this from a girl's perspective. My partner kept looking at the package afterwards like he couldn't believe what he has been missing out on his whole life. I guess I introduced him to a game-changer!\n", 
            "\n  Ok, these by far are one of the best condoms we've ever used. My husband LOVES that you can't feel it at all. We just couldn't believe that it was that thin until we opened the package. The only down side is that it's so thin we couldn't figure out which way to roll it on at first. Aside from that, it's still a 5 star product. Easy to open since all sides are designed to be able to be teared open. The only issue, that can be personally fixed, is the lubricant amount. It was not enough, but like I said, it is a fixable problem.", 
            "Note: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review\n", 
            "\n  My husband complains that these are really hard to get on and has had to throw some away because they are too tight and get messed up while putting them on. He is normal sized so shouldn't be an issue but they are really tight. Wouldn't buy again just because we feel we wasted so many in the process.\n", 
            "\n  My husband's words are: \"Feels awesome. I have never had anything so thin. I was nervous they were going to break, but they stood up to some rough sex. I would definitely recommend them.\"", 
            "I totally agree. I personally don't like the feeling of condoms as a woman. These felt allot closer to the real thing for both of us! They surprisingly haven't broken on us yet! We have been using them for over a week! (We have been using these and the silver which seen to have spermicide.) It's nice they are color coded for which side is which too! This makes it allot easier and less of a time waster to put on.", 
            "We'd say they feel a lot better! We can't afford to buy them every time, but it's definitely something I'll buy to treat my husband sometimes! They are worth the cost!!! We highly recommend them.", 
            "We received this box at a discount in order to test out the product and to leave an HONEST review.\n"

            "\n  The lubricant on these is gross and thick. It creates a weird dry-ish sensation that instantly kills my mood. It's kinda like covering your junk in honey and letting it dry out and get thick (don't ask). The size is a little small too, so beware, you Mandingos.\n",
