            "\n  Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!\n", 
            "\n  Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.  Some other reviews have said that the lotion is too effective but I found it to work perfectly for my needs.  I guess the only way to know for each person is to try it out for yourself.\n", 
            "\n  I was kinda nervous about putting that chemical on my penis but it wasn't that bad like other reviews say. Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.\n", 
            "\n  This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, \"Do you need it?\"", 
            "In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).", 
            "For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don't already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn't recommend that you use these.  You might find out the \"hard?\" way that you don't really need any extra help.\n", 
            "\n  Never had condoms break before I've tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same \"procedure\", \"preparation\", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.\n", 
            "\n  Good condom brand. I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!\n", 
            "\n  I picked these ones because of the amazon coupon you can clip but I'm glad I did.", 
            "The dots and ribs ad lots of pleasure for her and honestly these are the best quality condoms I've ever used, these things stretch like crazy without breaking.", 
            "Definitely recommend!\n", 
            "\n  Every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it. I have to remove that hard solid stuff to make sure I would not get hurt by this silly condom.\n"

These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....\n",

When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.\n", 
            "\n  Excellent product. After 3 weeks of using them my husband and I have never had one break, but like any condom sometimes a little extra lube is necessary. Overall when you have to use protection I'd never buy a different condom.\n",

I haven't experimented with a lot of different brands or variations, but I'm as happy as I can be wearing these ultra thins. They are still the thinnest I've tried from Trojan and meet all expectations.\n",

            "\n  My boyfriend and I had to go back to using condoms because the pill wasn't working out for me. We were hesitant about this brand at first because before I went on the pill we tried so many different brands and there was such a loss of feeling to them, a lot of times he couldn't keep an erection while wearing one. But with this brand, it truly is the closest thing to wearing nothing! It's amazing how much better it feels than a regular condom. We only buy these and Trojan ultra thin condoms now. They are the two best brands on the market if your partner has trouble keeping an erection with a normal condom. Also, we have never had one break so they seem to work just as well. Very happy with them. Give them a try!\n", 
            "\n  For someone with sensitive skin that reacts to just about everything (including latex) I have to say I got no skin reaction from this product. Would recommend to anyone with sensitive/reactive skin.\n", 
            "\n  Did a bit of shopping to prepare for the upcoming winter. Got a jacket, scarf and these gloves... Very confused by the packaging. Why are they individually wrapped? I've got two hands! The materials are also rather odd. Very slippery and doesn't seem well insulating. There must of been budget cuts at the factory after dealing with all the individual packaging because there's no finger holes! 0 out of 10 would not recommend. But I'm giving 5 stars just because I admire how unbreakable this weird thin stuff is.\n", 
            "\n  This box is ok if you want to try lifestyles variety in non-laytex. I am allergic to laytex so these are great and actually feel better than regular laytext condoms. However, within this variety box me and my bf found that the extra lubricated (inside and outside condom) ones where just a pain in the ass! (no pun intended , heheheh), they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful! we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn't come off and it was more of a mood killer. The other condoms in the box are great and stay put!\n", 
            "\n  I absolutely love this brand of condoms and won't be ordering any other brands in the future. They feel very comfortable and thin, and I haven't had one break yet. Unlike normal condoms they don't have that gross rubber smell. They're also perfect for people like me who have a latex allergy, and the ribbed condoms feel amazing! Extra lube is also pretty good. If you're not sure what type to get I'd try their variety pack.\n", 
            "\n  Feels like the real thing. Not pregnant, none have broken. Great replacement for hormonal birth control and inexpensive. I will buy again. The weirdly studded ones aren't our favorite but there's something for everyone in this fun pack. I recommend buying it to see which ones in the pack you and your partner enjoy & then buying what you like in bulk. Have safe fun my fellow Amazon shoppers!\n",

I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback.

If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to \"size up\" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.\n",

I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.\n",

The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.",

            "\n  Let me start out by saying I am on certain medications that make it difficult to finish what I start - Especially when wearing condoms. The first thing I noticed, was this rolls on like a second skin. The fit is FANTASTIC! I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick. One partner reached multiple Oh's and described a very pleasurable experience with Lelo Hex. The sensations I felt allowed me to get where I wanted to go, too!",

I did not notice any special sensation from the raised inner hexagons and really cannot tell if they are any stronger because of it but there have been no tears so far. It's not the same as going bareback but this is as close as I have found, very happy with these.\n", 
            "\n  These are awesome, ignore the lesbian that for some reason bought these. The condom is extra tight, which works great with the thin hexagonal latex. It seems the hexagons add friction so the condom is actually not moving during sex.\n", 
            "\n  Was not able to sense any changes to the fit, but the performance was very good with no stretching or breakage.  The line was decent and lasted a long time.",

            "Each barrier did what they were supposed to do.\n", 
            "\n  This is the first change to the basic design in years and years, and it's a great success.  Unfortunately, this is marketed as a luxury item and carries a cost associated with luxury, putting it out of reach of the people who need it most.\n", 
            "\n  Interesting design. I must say these fit better than a normal condom and stay on better too. The feel is amazing, super thin. This is definitely my preferred condom now, the design is just head and shoulders above the rest.\n", 
            "\n  Love these condoms. No smell. Great fit and super thin like I'm not even wearing anything at all. I've used Trojans, Durex, Lifestyles...you name it but they don't come close to this. This will be a permanent switch and I'm so glad someone changed the game for condoms.\n"

All styles are lubricated. I was quite pleased to see brands that I recognize and honestly like using and frequently buy: Beyond Seven is a good condom brand in my opinion so I am happy that I got them.

            "\n  I have tried the Lifestyle Extended condom before and it was a quarter of the numbness of this Trojan condom. This condom will numb you and your partner. If I was the only one getting numb it would not be too bad, but it becomes alot more less pleasurable when your partner is numb too. Since I already bought it, I use the strategy of putting on this condom then changing it before we have sex. I much prefer the lifestyles condom even though Trojan is considered a \"better\" brand.\n", 
            "\n  I really didn't like this product. Thought it was going to help make things last a little longer, but it actually made me go numb, or at least that's what it felt like, which in turn, if you cant feel anything down there at all, it tends to go limp...\n",

            "\n  As soon as I used to get in my girlfriend, I would go nuts and end it. But with these  condoms, I can keep going and going. Actually it was so long, the V med started to wear off. It also kept her from pregnancy, at least till that other guy dated her.\n",

These run a bit snugger than others I've worn, but they're not uncomfortable and they do give an ultra thin fit and feel.  I haven't had any break, though that has never been a common experience for us either.  The box is discreet, the individual products are very sleek and give a more elegant look.",

The price on these has been increasing steadily, and I hope they stop at least to match the regular prices we find in stores.",

            "\n  When I bought these, I was pretty paranoid that they would all have expiration dates of 1 year from my date of purchase. Luckily, they are all good till 2015! The bowl comes in a thin (and super jam packed) plastic bowl with four varieties of condoms (Natural Feeling, Pleasure Max, Extra Sensitive, Her Sensation. The picture is deceiving in that it shows a rainbow condom but that was not included in the bowl). I'm not a believer that the condom type makes a huge difference, so the variety didn't really matter to me, but in case you are, each condom is color coded and you can tell what type they are by the black print on the non-colored side of the condom.", 
            "The condoms themselves are pretty durable. I haven't had one break so far and honestly that's all the matters. So, if you need tons of condoms, this is the product for you.", 
            "For those who are curious, you'd have to have sex 2.77 times a week in order to use up all these condoms in a year.\n", 
            "\n  I'm giving 3 stars only because it arrived on time. Other than that I am very disappointed in the fact that they advertised different flavors and rainbow colors. Yet when you get the package it's just 4 different types. Not really a variety being that there's a total of 144 so i would expect more of an assortment especially since that is what the picture and description displays to you. As you can see in the picture i only got 4 different  types and just my luck i got a huge amount of purple which happens to be our least favorite type of durex condom. Definitely a let down to now we got all excited for a variety and were sadly disappointed.\n", 
            "\n  1. My girlfriend is not pregnant. I mean, not that I know of, anyway.", 
            "2. There are a lot of condies swimming around in this fish bowl. Perfect for stashing all over the house like the Punisher hides guns everywhere.\n", 
            "\n  I thought I'd never get a handle on Halloween. I tried giving out homemade candy apples -- the parents wouldn't accept them. I tried buying bulk candy and putting it in little baggies -- no dice. You can get little boxes of raisins in great quantity, but cleaning the toilet paper out of the trees wasn't worth it the next day.", 
            "So imagine my glee at finding this one-stop-shopping solution. Individually wrapped? Check. Colorful variety? Check. Enough for the dozens of trick-or-treaters we get at Halloween? Check. They even come in their own jar!", 
            "All this needs is a \"PLEASE TAKE ONE\" sign and I'll be all ready for October 31st. Let's see the neighborhood watch find something wrong with my candy THIS year!\n", 
            "\n  I bought this for my fish, a Beta named Carlos.  A \"variety fish bowl condom\" you say?  I thought you put it over your fish bowl to make it easier to change the water.  You just snap it on, flip it over and BAM, done.  But no, it's filled with actual Durex condoms.  Not being the wasteful type, I feng shuied them around in there, added some water and now Carlos has a styling new bachelor pad.  No more awkward search of the nightstand when he has over a lady-Beta.  He is literally, and I mean literally, swimming in condoms.  All in all, not what I expected but a high quality product.\n", 
            "\n  \"Life is like a condom fishbowl; you never know what you're going to get\" The packages don't seem to say what the condom type will be (lubed, studded, ultra thin, etc.) so it is always a surprise.\n", 
            "\n  Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .  I personally wish they weren't colored but I know that most flavored condoms are. All of them expire at leat three years out from the date I ordered them.  Some don't expire for 4. We are very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying them again.  Though it will probably be a while before we need to!\n", 
            "\n  Whats going on Durex? I got my first bowl that didn't have a cover. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover. Despite there being a cover on all the pictures on Amazon. So lets call it what it really is a GAME OF 144 PICKUP. You even put it in one of the tipsiest shapes known to man the fishbowl. Maybe you figure many will be lost and you will have quicker reorders. Would the 2 cents for a cover break the bank at Durex?\n"

We especially liked the variety to choose from. The silver box they come in is so discreet and also very useful because boxes always rip or the condoms are falling out everywhere. Not really helpful if you are trying to hide them from kids. haha!\n", 
            "\n  Needed a form of birth control after my son was born that wouldn't effect lactation with hormones...condoms are the simplest choice. My husband was buying these at the store in three packs for a huge markup. I told him I'm too cheap to pay $2 every time we want to use one when there are less expensive options...so I got on Amazon to see the price difference and buy in bulk...so glad I did. These work well, I honestly don't feel much difference between types, my husband says the thinner the better. He has always liked the durex brand best so we stick with it.",

I mean, I try to be chemical free in everything else, so after a little thought, I decided to opt for a latex condom without chemical lubricants and dyes and fragrance. You can buy these on Amazon too, they are called sustain condoms. They are beautifully packaged, natural and vegan...I'm not vegan, but appreciate the qualifications a vegan product must have...if the chemical load of conventional condoms gets to you too, maybe durex isn't for you either.\n",

The \"flavored\" condoms do have a taste! which surprised me because I've tried another flavored brand and it was nothing much but a scent and no taste. But these do and my girlfriend noticed and enjoyed it for a bit, the taste doesn't last but its better than it just being scented.\n",

            "\n  These are hands down the holy grail of condoms. I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.", 
            "So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.\n",

But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).\n", 
            "\n  I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like \"get that thing away from me\" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking \"thinnest condoms in the world\" great!", 
            "I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.", 
            "Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.", 
            "I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.", 
            "I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!", 
            "I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.\n", 
            "\n  First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was \" Oh S***....Damn.\" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.\n", 
            "\n  Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.\n", 
            "\n  I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.\n", 
            "\n  I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.", 
            "On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.", 
            "My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.", 
            "Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.\n"

I've previously only used the Magnum Thin condoms but even they sometimes (maybe even frequently) lead to such a reduction in sensitivity that gladly kills my boner.  Sure, you're always going to know you're wearing a condom but these let me feel everything, seemed to go with the movement, and seemed to be a little looser than other Magnum condoms.  Given how impossibly thin the BareSkin condoms are, the bit of extra wiggle room - whether perceived or actual - probably contributes to its strength.  If a normal sized condom feels snug and you have $8, there's ZERO reason to not try these.  I mean, who says, \"I wish the latex was a little bit thicker.\"??\n", 
            "\n  I wish they had these when I was in college! I've always hated condoms and I must have tried over 30 different brands and types over the years. These ones though I am happy with! (Well, as happy as someone can be when using them that is.) They fit well, you can feel a bit more than with other condoms, and the price is right. Just be sure to use a good lube!\n", 
            "\n  My girlfriend commented on these during our first use! She asked me if I was using a different condom, and that it felt amazing! I used to use the Trojan Magnum Thin, but these are WAY thinner, and let you feel WAY more. They also have less lubricant (FYI if that's an issue) but on the plus side they don't have the rather unpleasant lubricant smell of the Magnum Thin's and Original's.\n", 
            "\n  Taking thin to the new level.  you have tried the thins..  well, now it is time to step to the BareSkins.  I gave the thins 10 stars (well, I gave five and my girlfriend gave five).  We give these 15 stars total.  That is right, a 50% increase in mutual satisfaction.  If it can't be skin on skin, go with the BareSkins.  You will not regret it.\n", 
            "\n  Simply the best condom ever. My partner noticed the difference and stated it felt as if i was not wearing a condom at all. I can also feel the extreme difference in comparison to other condoms. This one is very thin and diminish sensitivity very little. Since my first purchase tis is my 3 box with no breakages yet.\n", 
            "\n  After trying so many condoms I have finally found my go to. Please Trojan, do not stop making these and keep on making more.\n", 
            "\n  Much thinner then previous Magnums.  It's annoying though that I can't seem to find the Magnum XL anymore. These ones fit very tight and left a deep purple ring on my penis and as in sure most of you reading this are aware, these don't cover the entire length of the penis either.  If they made these a little longer/wider I feel like they would be my go to condom. Hopefully they'll see enough of us complaining and make the Magnum XL in a bare skin style.\n"

So it's a necessary evil.  Nonetheless, I hate condoms to the extent where just opening the wrapper made Senor Johnson go back to sleep almost instantaneously.", 
            "But Senor Johnson approves of these.  They're so thin that you'd think they'd tear easily, but I've never had one of these fail in my life.  They're well lubed without leaving you sliding all over the place, and they don't have that noxious smell that gets progressively worse as bodily fluids get involved.  These are as inoffensive as condoms get.", 
            "The only problem with them is that they're a bit tight, even by average standards.  For average Joes, that might be a good thing since it's absolutely impossible to slip out of these unless Senor Johnson passes out.  But if your Senor Johnson is pornstar tier, these might feel more like a mechanical vice than a condom.  So if you have that problem, god bless you and look elsewhere.",

            "As for a specific box of these condoms:", 
            "The box I received was in pristine condition, however they can be damaged along the way. My experience tells me that if handled properly, these condoms are very reliable. As always, check the box and individual wrappers before using.",

            "\n  I'm always looking for a better condom, but I haven't found one yet. I will continue to try new condoms but so far I always end up coming back to these. Great sensation, easy to put on and they don't dry up quickly. I can't give a condom 5 stars though because it's still a condom.\n", 
            "\n  My Partner and I both agree that these condoms feel much better than Trojans, And Lifestyles. Mainly because of its extremely thin properties, and proper lubrication. We've used over 100 and have been quite satisfied with the results, we would recommend this product to anyone sexually active and want something better than trojans, and lifestyles.\n", 
            "\n  So I ordered on 2 occasions. First time was sold by QUIVERR in January.  Package was immaculate.  3 Boxes 12 each shrink wrapped. Not expiring any time soon. Second time sold by RYMATT WELLNESS LLC package came in big zip lock bag with 3 individual smaller bags of 12.  So 50/50 on the wrapping issue that people talking about.  I opened right away and looked for any holes or any signs of tampering and expiration date of 2020.  I can't see any defects.  I'll let you know in a couple of months! {nervous laughter}\n",

            "\n  My wife and I recently had to start using condoms again, and like most guys I was a little bummed out.  I had the idea that I would buy a large assortment and maybe we would find something we liked, or at least didn't mind so much.  After receiving these (less than a workweek after my order) we both couldn't wait to try some of them out.  I was happy with the selection I got-- it did include all the brands they listed, 2 or 4 of most kinds and a good handful of Crowns which are probably a cheap filler but good nonetheless.  I was happy that only 2 types of Trojan condoms were included because they have been a disappointment to us in the past. After trying out several kinds we have both figured out what we do and don't like, and once these are gone I can buy our favorites in bulk.  It has been exciting to try out all the different kinds that are new to us such as textured, different sizes, colors, shapes, and even glow in the dark. The only heads-up is that these, like most bulk condoms on Amazon, are shipped loose in a padded envelope.  Doesn't hurt to give them a quick look-over especially if the envelope looks like it has handled rough.  All of ours were just fine.  Overall very happy with this purchase.\n",

            "\n  For a latex condom these aren't bad at all. They don't have a latex smell like some of the other brands (Durex and Trojan) do. They're pretty thin and very strong; however they're not as thin as the polyurethane condoms (Sagami) that I have been using the last year and half. Would I recommend these? Sure, for someone wanting an inexpensive yet reliable latex condom they're pretty good. As far as size goes; I'm average in width (55mm) and length; I guess I'm used to using polyurethane condoms that don't stretch and fit snug; something I was hoping would also be the case with these. The base of these holds pretty tight and the shaft is pretty close, but they stretch ALOT and don't hold tight quite like the poly condoms do that dont stretch. These came packaged lose inside a plastic mailing bag; they were doubled (two condoms) per piece; labeled not for retail sale. I was actually surprised to see these as in my mailbox because I had canceled my order; yet someone at CS must have made a mistake and sent them anyway. I'm not complaining, getting a bag chocked full of condoms for free isn't a bad deal. The dates were good till 2020; I opened three of them to see what they looked and felt like and all were nice silky smooth in texture and had no smell.\n",

We use some lube anyway so it was pretty much a tie. I looked up condoms on Consumer Reports and found that the LifeStyles ULTRA SENSITIVE made a perfect score! That's why I ended up going with these. Hard to argue with science and you certainly can't beat this price.\n",

            "\n  perfect fit for me!  I've been having a problem with condoms slipping off especially with my girlfriend now that gets extremely wet.  I knew it was because of my under average size but she loves it anyways :)  These condoms are amazing though.  Snug fit and won't fall off.  She loves them to because its tighter around my penis which makes it feel better for her apparently.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms work nicely. What to say? They do their job! They're nice and snug. We're still not pregnant, so that's good!\n", 
            "\n  If you do not have a large girth, these condoms are for you.  They are a little tight around the base, but I find that gives me better and longer orgasms. However, if you are one with a large penis, this is not for you.\n", 
            "\n  I was expecting a sealed box, instead I got a bag with 25ct just as described. The seller should say they come in a ziploc type bag. Other than that they fit snug alright :) .\n", 
            "\n  They actually fit very well... Every other kind of condom comes off of my penis but these stay on and don't slip down or off. I'm about 3 inches and 2 inches thick and these fit amazingly. So glad I found these.\n", 
            "\n  When they say Snug, they should say Hulk Hogan Death Grip. I was hoping for something slightly more snug but these actually hurt if left on too long. Feels super tight. For the price, its worth trying them for yourself, don't read reviews for condoms and hope to find your answer here. Trial and error is your best bet.\n", 
            "\n  Ordered these and they came in 2 days.... really comfortable fit.... just enough lubricant. .... I'm 5 inches and have s small girth. ..... like how it hugs all around... only negative comment was I still had a Lil extra condom that was hanging off the tip... extra large resovior tip.... cortezf00@gmail.com\n", 
            "\n  Nice fit without slipping off.  This is the first condom that didn't slip off.  Would like to see more in this catagory being offered.\n"

Perhaps because I'm also a little larger, so the comment that said it's a \"trash bag\" is more about sizing than anything else.  Great for bigger guys, there's room and it is tapered at the bottom so it stayed on great.\n", 
            "\n  My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.\n",

            "Size:", 
            "I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.", 
            "Shape:", 
            "They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.", 
            "Lube:", 
            "The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.\n", 
            "\n  If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the \"ribbing\" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I've ever encountered.  Frigging' Yuck.\n", 
            "\n  These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.\n", 
            "\n  Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.\n"

December 14, 2015, I ordered the same condom from Amazon. They expire October 2019, and are from batch number T4Y4. I have no guarantee that the old batch was produced in Japan, but there is a slight chance. Condom Depot wrote an article (\"Crown Condoms Thailand & Japan What\u2019s The Deal?\") regarding the differences between manufacturing locations, dated March 11, 2009. In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row.

            "\n  Well, in terms of protection, Crown skinless has always been my go-to brand and style. Next to that, Beyond Sevens, however most people vouch for Crown over Beyond Seven (both produced by the same company, however Crown is featured in many ahem, feature films...)", 
            "The crown is comfortable, if a little snug for most men. It's also relatively thin, along the lines of .0042 thickness, if I recall correctly. You can get .002 and .002 thickness with other Japanese brands, however the price increases exponentially and the availability decreases as well. Crown is a wonderful go-between, but do be careful regarding the manufacturing locations.", 
            "Many years ago I purchased them when they were the original silver and blue packaging. They were thin and barely felt like they were there. These new blue and white packets feel thicker to me for some reason, though it could be because I went for a period without the need for condoms, and now that things have changed, it's hard adapting back to the ole latex.", 
            "I've used MANY of these condoms and have not had one failure. They are only lightly lubricated so make sure things are good to go before going at it or you'll create some heavy friction that's unpleasant for your partner (and bad for the latex). Very little smell on these, which is great, and the pink color almost makes it look invisible, which is another bonus.", 
            "I am getting used to these, and have almost finished my current 50 pack. If you're a Durex or generic store-brand user, you owe it to yourself to give the Crowns a shot. They will literally blow your mind.\n"

            "\n  I hate condoms.  Almost as much as I hate hormonal contraception.  However, with a two-year-old and a two-month-old at home, my husband positively refuses to come anywhere near me without one.  By luck, when I first went shopping for condoms a month ago, I purchased these.  They were AWESOME.  I decided condoms weren't so bad after all.  However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.  (Obviously, I'm new to this, so I wasn't up-to-speed yet on the differences between latex and lambskin condoms.)  There is simply no comparison.  I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.  They're worth every penny.  Just look at it this way:  You could purchase thousands of these, and they'd still be less expensive than a child.  :)\n", 
            "\n  After having our first baby, I didn't want to take any form of hormone contraception.  Unfortunately, traditional latex condoms were really uncomfortable for me.  We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)", 
            "We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.  I'm not aiming to get pregnant with a 6.5-month-old infant at home, and we are happy that these condoms have been the key to allowing my husband and me to keep the love-light burning.  :)", 
            "Edit:  After nearly four months of use, we've found that the condoms aren't all the same size.  Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.  They're a bit pricy (compared to latex), so that's unfortunate.  Even so, I definitely wouldn't let that stop me from buying another box!  They are definitely the best!\n", 
            "\n  Without a doubt these suckas keep my dude piston feeling all natural.  Latex just desensitizes the junk, while the skin-to-skin feels awesome!  Boom!  Nearest to wearing nothing, these jimmy hats are the Real Deal Holyfield!",

            "\n  My partner and I can hardly feel these at all. I gave up hormonal birth control entirely, and now use only these, and they have worked perfectly. They transmit all the heat and feeling, and you don't have the problem with friction that you do with latex condoms.", 
            "My advice: They are a little harder to roll into place, but you can be a little rough with them to tug them down - they've never broken on us. Remember to leave room at the tip, and that these DON'T protect against HIV or other STDs.\n", 
            "\n  It feels a bit odd rating this item, but I am doing so because someone needs to inform women about this product.  To be honest, I was extremely hesitant to try this product.  Husband and I are in our early forties and I have been informed by my physician to consider going off of birth control pills.  I was not open to having my tubes tied (nor the expense), nor did I want an IUD floating around inside me for years.  In addition, my husband was not open to having a vasectomy, as he is a physician and saw one too many men in his office w/difficulties from that procedure.  I ran across this Naturalamb product while shopping at a local pharmacy and took a stab at it.  For the record, my husband and I do not prefer to use condoms, but I took a stab at it and purchased a small box anyway.  Well, suffice it to say that neither I nor my husband have a single complaint about this product.  This product feels very, very natural.  I do  highly recommend.\n", 
            "\n  My vagina is basically allergic to everything. Almost everything sets off a yeast infection. I've tried every condom variation under the sun. Extra lube, no spermicide, non latex, lube free. These lamb skins do give me a slight reaction but it is by far the least bad reaction out of all the ones I've tried. I'll take that as a win.\n", 
            "\n  My wife wanted to stop taking the pill, since she's been on it for most of her life. I wasn't real crazy about the idea of using condoms, but it was definitely my turn to shoulder some of the contraceptive responsibility. After trying these condoms, I have no problem using them for the rest of my reproductive days. These are definitely the best condoms ever made- the truly feel like you aren't wearing one at all. That would be the one downside, if there are any. My wife and I have had a few moments where we weren't sure if the condom was still on because it felt so \"natural.\" As horrible as it sounds, I guess that's a good problem to have :)\n"

The sensitive ones suddenly become super sensitive.  My favorite actually turned out to be the glow in the dark one.  And yes it does work.  open it up first let it collect a little room light while you give your lady a little moonlight. wink wink.  Then strap on.  The small fit does some...lets say extending of time.  And the glow in the dark is actually a little thicker so not quite as sensitive.

And in case you wonder the \"Legend\" one that comes in the pack is slightly bigger than durex or regular Trojan's.\n",

This sample is perfect for figuring out which \"One\" is the the \"One\" for you!\n",

            "This is the only condom where I more than once thought it fell off to realize that it hadn't, it was just so thin that it felt like you had nothing on.  These are the only condoms that I don't mind putting on.  Let's just say that it can get very dangerous if you're coming up with excuses to not put on a jimmy hat because you don't like the feel.  Yeah, these condoms may be expensive, but consider the upside: you won't mind putting them on, and you could be saving yourself large bills from a disease/pregnancy.", 
            "Now to the other people who have reviewed this product: are you all porn stars??!  I'll tell you my size to put it in perspective: I'm almost 7\" with above-average girth.  I'm kind of big.  The large condoms fit me fine.  Hell, I'm wearing the normal ones right now, and although the length is a little short, they're still wearable and fit comfortably.  I would take the other reviewers' opinions with a grain of salt as I have had zero issues wearing these.\n", 
            "\n  Dude, you can barely feel them... Its like nothing is there... the only kind ill buy son... They are strong, and transfer heat so you feel the good stuff instead of a piece of latex... Buy them... they are a bit more expensive  but well worth the price...\n", 
            "\n  The three stars is only because the size of the base ring is much tighter than I expected after doing a lot of research and was expecting it to fit closer to a regular condom (maybe around 54 mm in width) and it was much tighter, and the three stars is not for the quality Sagami condom brand. For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers. For now for the times I use polyurethane condoms I will use the Okamoto 002 Large that fit closer to a regular condom because for me the base ring was too tight on these Sagami 002 Original.\n", 
            "\n  These are great, a little bit tighter than what I am used to (normally use skyn or supra). Had to check and make sure it was still there a few times, not a bad thing. Work very well and I will certainly be buying more. I really want to try the .01, but I have only seen them in the smaller size which I don't think will work out for me.\n", 
            "\n  Compared to wearing condoms off the self, the Sagami 002 is far superior. While I have yet to try the applauded Sagami 001, this condom comes in a larger pack, which was a decided factor in my purchase.\n", 
            "\n  Wondrous joy! Thinnest condom on the market (though I've heard of the elusive 0.01mm, but cannot find it)! Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)", 
            "Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...", 
            "If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2\" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir. I've read that these condoms are ~1.4\" girth, but up to 2\", you'll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don't work out for you.\n", 
            "\n  The best condoms out there! I have tried A LOT of different brands over the years and I can say hands down, this gives the most natural feel. Really does seem like there's nothing there. This is a VERY close next best thing to nothing at all!\n", 
            "\n  my Husband loves these condoms. He says they're the thinnest condom he's tried. Quite tight, so they're sometimes tricky to get on. Definitey prefer it without, of course, but we don't want any more kids for a while, and I don't like birth control. Anyway, definitely our favorite condom!\n"

            "One thing I don't like about latex is that it stretches too much. A little stretch is ok, but as the condom stretches, it loses integrity and starts to cut off circulation. Polyurethane stretches too, but it is much stronger than latex, so these condoms are thinner than normal condoms and don't stretch as much, so I actually feel like it is more a part of me. I am able to have sex for long periods without cutting off circulation, or having to change out the condom.", 
            "When I first tried these, I was sold. My girl (at the time ;-) hated using condoms, but actually liked the feel of these. I will never have sex without condoms again (until I find Mrs. Right of course). I only wish these were available in stores around me. Even if I wasn't allergic to latex, I would use these. If you have not tried this exact product, you have not felt what polyurethane CAN do. The competition's polyurethane condoms are terrible (understatement of the century), so when I hear men bag on polyurethane, I have to say that they never tired this product.",

As an experiment, I just opened one up, and was able to put it on over my closed fist and unroll it down past my wrist.  If you can't get these things on, you're not too large, you're doing it wrong. I have not had any problem with breakage either.\n",

            "\n  I love these things! Sometimes they feel a big too snug, and if you aren't completely erect it's hard to get on due to the tightness. However, once it is on it's an awesome experience. The polyurethane is great because it doesn't stretch out as much, it stays right where it is and enables a more \"natural\" feeling. The only downside to that is that it isn't particularly elastic, so if it does start stretching out a bit (generally from things getting too dry) it doesn't go back to its original shape. Because of this, we'll generally just take it off and throw a fresh one on. But I still prefer it to latex, hands down.", 
            "If you use this and pair it with a good lubricant (I use Wet Platinum Premium), it's about as close to \"raw\" as your going to get in my experiences. The thinness of it and the material mixed with the tightness and the wetness of the lubricant really simulates the real thing nicely.  If you're in the \"larger\" department down there, don't get this. It's not going to be comfortable. But if you're average, this should do the trick.", 
            "I spent most of my sex life using birth control, and only recently went back to condoms, and it's hard to \"get into the mood\" when you have to throw one of these on, they reduce the feeling a lot too. But this particular brand has definitely helped getting back into the use of these, highly recommend you give it a shot!\n",

The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)",

Never having ordered this kind of thing in bulk, I assumed they'd come in a large Costco-style Okamoto/Crown box, or retail packaging of some kind. Instead they came in a plastic bag. It definitely weirded me out at first. When I thought about it I realized of course if you're buying them in bulk they'll arrive that way, it just startled me when I first saw it. All of these condoms appear to expire in 2017 so I have plenty of time to go through them. I will update once I've had the chance to use them (though god only knows when that will be *sigh*).\n",

Although I can't verify that because this is my first purchase. These condoms are awesome! Unfortunately though, I've only been able to use one in two weeks. \ud83d\ude2d What the H!  At this rate they'll last forever. Maybe I'll just try them on for fun. Oh - I could learn how to tie balloon animals.\n",

Also they are very inexpensive (100pk for 15 dollars) one thing to remember is that as stated on the label it is lightly lubricated. So it's best to apply some extra especially if you plan on going for more then 10 mins. Another thing if you have more girth or length then average you will realize that it can be a snug condom. I personally felt like it didn't roll down close enough to my base a problem I haven't had with any other condom\n",

Purchased in bulk for use with toys I share with my partner; if you do the same, just treat them with care when applying and they hold up pretty well.  Non-distinct taste for me.\n"

            "Well, I still don't know the answer to B), but after going through a box of Skyn condoms, I can honestly say that I would use them even if my partner weren't allergic to latex. They feel significantly better than the condoms I've used in the past (Trojans), and they're reliable. As a bonus, buying them here is vastly cheaper, more convenient, and less embarrassing than buying them at Walgreen's. I'd recommend this product to anyone who relies on condoms for birth control with a significant other, latex allergy or not.", 
            "When I ordered a second box, the seller accidentally put the wrong item in the package. The packing slip showed the correct order, but instead of 50 Skyn condoms there were 50 Snugger Fit condoms, which are made from latex. I contacted the seller through Amazon, explained that the latex condoms were useless to me because of my girlfriend's latex allergy, and requested that the correct item be sent to me as soon as possible.", 
            "My complaint was filed on Monday night. On Tuesday morning I had a response from the seller, who apologized for the error and said that the correct item was on its way. On Wednesday morning the correct condoms were on my doorstep via Fed Ex.

Don't listen, Im 7 1/2 and close to two inches in diameter and these roll almost all the way down to the base and don't feel too tight. I don't get the \"plastic bag\" sensation with these.  Ive found normal trojans to be too tight and went with the larger size. These however fit wonderfully. very comfortable, no slippage, almost no odor and they transmit heat well. I really like that they are not slathered in lubricant as well. there is some but not too much.\n", 
            "\n  I've used over 100 of these (years before their expiration dates) and have never had one break. They work very well for my latex allergy. The seller \"Chubby Dick Emporium\" also delivered in less than a week with free shipping, and provided 4+ years before expiration.\n",

These don't chafe, smell weird, or cause irritation and the price is unbelievable. I barely notice these when using and neither does my boyfriend. I will be purchasing again.\n",

            "I've never been a fan of Trojan. Every time I use them I feel very uncomfortable, like they never seem to fit right, or the specified \"effect\" or \"special lubricant\" or whatever never seems to stack up to their claims. To my knowledge i'm not allergic to latex but with trojan condoms I seem to display qualities of a latex allergy without any of the more unpleasant side effects (swelling, inflamation, ect).", 
            "Being that I didn't know if latex was the problem I decided for the hell of it to try something else and since lamb skin are less effective percentage wise, my friend recommended these to me about 5 years ago. After seeing a commercial I finally gave in and bought a bulk pack of like 12 or whatever, and I haven't bought another brand since.", 
            "Not only are they extremely comfortable (as far as these type of products go) but they really do simulate the sensation of \"wearing nothing\" better than any other product on the market. Application and removal is a breeze. no bunching, snagging, pinching or any of those unpleasant problems posed by thick latex style products. And best of all they stretch and conform without ever losing their seal. Fantastic product.\n", 
            "\n  I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction. As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.", 
            "One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you're ... y'know ... \"oversized,\" you might find these too tight. My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.\n", 
            "\n  Polyisoprene is extremely superior to latex in sensation and comfort, particularly in temperature transfer. Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice. Plus partners may be mildly irritated by latex and not be aware of it - using polyisoprene ensures a better chance of everyone having the best experience possible. Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.\n", 
            "\n  Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:", 
            "- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort.", 
            "- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation.", 
            "- They have no particular smell or flavour.", 
            "- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too.",

            "\n  The female condom is amazing. It is more pleasurable for both the male & female than traditional condoms; and offers more protection against STDS that can be spread by skin to skin contact by covering the outer area of the vagina. The ring that remains out of the vagina adds extra clitoral stimulation and friction during inner course. My boyfriend question if I was really wearing it the first time we used one, because it felt sooo good he couldn't tell. I love that I can put it in before we even begin to mess around - so there is no momentum lost fumbling around for a condom. Plus since they are non latex you can use any lube you want. They are big, which seemed weird at first glance- but once I tried them I was hooked.  I just wish local stores carried them.", 
            "I have literally given them to all my friends to try. I don't understand why they are not the preferred condom. All my friends who tried them made the switch.\n", 
            "\n  The sensation as a man was pretty excellent. There is a lot less worry about slippage than with a traditional condom. My partner did complain about the weirdness that she was feeling when she first inserted it, but it was less noticeable after a small amount of time.\n", 
            "\n  I dont know why these arent more popular, cant buy them locally anywhere. The best way to use them is with minimal lubrication on \"her\" side, preferably just none but her own, and use more lube on the inside. Otherwise it can slide in and out.\n", 
            "\n  Partner thought it felt better than a male condom, but it got pushed inside & we were unprotected for a minute. Had to hold it in place the rest of the time. I won't buy again.\n", 
            "\n  My husband and I really like these.  He is a bit larger, so they are more comfortable for him than regular condoms, and I like them for when I'm feeling extra sensitive and don't want quite as much stimulation. Also, the fact that they are nitrile instead of latex is a big plus.  I didn't think we would like these, but we very much do.\n", 
            "\n  I think that these are a great option if your partner has erectile issues and you need extra protection. I am married and monogamous and cannot do hormone birth control. I also use spermicide. The combo left me with a god awful smell but Id rather deal with a smell for a couple of days (even after bathing) than everything that can come from not using protection. I find that missionary position works best so you can hold on to the condom. Switching positions didn't work out too well. So for me, once you put it in and start a position, stay in that position if you can. The spermicidal lube really helped the feeling for my spouse. Good luck!\n", 
            "\n  The product is easy to use and feels very natural.\n", 
            "\n  Loved it - if you are looking for a non hormonal option - that  not only protects but lubricate - this is an excellent option. He enjoyed it too -- it is our go to contraception now!\n"

Third place would be Durex ultra thin which also has a very pleasant but mostly neutral smell.  Skyn kind of stinks but always seem to work.",

But I felt more pleasure towards the tip and was afraid it ripped during the intercourse but wasn't so.  Yes it's pricey but I would say if you want the thinnest this is it.  If not Skyn Elite and Durex ultra thin would be my other choice.  The Crown's diameter seemed bit smaller and was too tight for me.",

Neither is truly large or extra large in the heroic porn film sense. In terms of actual fit, keep in mind that condoms stretch a lot and you can blow them up like balloons or use them in an emergency to carry water. So, the regular size might feel snug going on and be slightly more difficult to roll down, BUT it's still going to fit and once it's on you can't tell the difference in sizes.", 
            "So apart from a placebo effect, there probably isn't a condom made that is \"too small\". A little award to roll on, for sure, but not too small.", 
            "This is important because the \"Large\" Sagami, which I prefer, is twice as expensive as the \"Regular\" Sagami. Who knows why, but that's the case. Also, all the sellers seem to be located overseas. I sure hope someone take the time to officially import these because they are fantastic.\n", 
            "\n  Four stars was a difficult rating because of the fit, but given they are not for the US market four stars if a fair rating.  As a product, like others have said the lubrication is great and the feel truly is wonderful, but the sizing can be misleading.  If you have tried something like a Magnum and find yourself to be right in between that and standard, you will most likely find these to be tight.  If you finish rolling down a standard condom and don't have much left, the Sagami will be short.  These don't have the same type of reservoir tip you may be used to, so a short, tight condom could result in bypass leakage.", 
            "I agree with others that if they made an american fitment (or an XL based on Japanese sizing) they would be my absolute favorite.",

I got the package quickly loves how the individual condoms are packaged (no ripping nasty aluminum or plastic with your teeth). These have slight lubrication so no need for more.",

            "In all honesty, I am a repeat bareback offender as I hate the feel of condoms. I bought these as a last resort since the Crowns didn't really do the trick for me. What I loved the most was the really small (almost non-existing) reservoir head. I HATE the look of the deflated reservoir just flapping around at the tip it makes me conscious that the condom IS there, and that defeats the purpose of having a little fun.",

            "\n  After trying many others options I arrived at these many years ago and I haven't used anything else since. That said I feel very confident that these are genuine and of the same great quality I've come to expect from Lifestyles. I generally need a larger condom and the comfort tip on these accommodate that nicely. They're thin enough that they're not restrictive and though they fit me a little more on the snug side I've been loyal to this brand/style for over ten years and I've yet to break one which is more than I can say for many of the others I've tried. They're offered here at a great value and if you're an average or larger man I'd recommend these!", 
            "If you're on the smaller side, I'd recommend you try something different as I imagine these might be a struggle to keep on for smaller guys because of the combination of them being on the thinner side and the comfort tip.\n", 
            "\n  After years of trying, and failing, to have kids, we stopped worrying about birth control.  Then our daughter surprised us last year.  Now we have to worry about it for the first time in 12+ years.  Condoms never bothered me when I was younger.  Now that I'm older, and haven't had to wear one in forever, they don't seem as comfortable.  These are okay.  Do what they need to do.  I certainly wouldn't consider them to be \"Ultra Sensitive\" or anything special.  I do know that I always preferred LifeStyles back in the day.\n", 
            "\n  Never been satisfied with any condoms from companies other than Trojan. Since LifeStyles condoms were best sellers at Walmart with a great price. So, gave it a try, and loved them.", 
            "As for this product, it's good and all but they do not come packaged in the proper box. 50 of these were packaged nicely in a plastic bag. I do not have any complaints but just an FYI.\n", 
            "\n  Even though i hate  having to use them  these are the best i have used , forget the cheap imposters trust me  buy these condoms they feel great putting them on and when they are put in no great loss of sensation.\n", 
            "\n  DO NOT USE! These condoms lack lubrication and have come off 3 times during intercourse in the past year, lodging themselves deep inside my partner's vagina. At first we thought this was the result of human error, but then we realized it only happened with this specific condom. I have never had a similar incident in many years of sex with all different brands and models of condoms, and neither has my partner. This is a highly ineffective -- not to mention dangerous -- product!\n", 
            "\n  Good value but the damn things came with an invoice that says \"Chubby Dick Emporium.\" This was an embarrassing surprise, as they arrived in a padded envelope at work and the receptionist opened the envelope and pulled the invoice before realizing it was a \"personal\".\n", 
            "\n  I received a few of these during the LGBT Pride Parade of 2016 in New York City, and the Ultra Sensitive Condoms have proven to be durable and well-lubricated. While it almost feels like you are not wearing a condom, it is difficult to tear these. Highly recommended.\n", 
            "\n  fast shipping ..everything was intact and the product itself works good and is comfortable.. the price was very good and definitely would buy again.\n"

We personally prefered the SKYN brand ones, he said it almost felt like he was wearing nothing. The Durex brand had great lubrication and is our second choice although they're a bit tight. The Trojan ones were really too small and very tight and I don't think very well lubricated. I would absolutely recommend this product if you are trying out condoms, it's a lot cheaper than buying an entire box of something you may not like or doesn't fit well. It was extremely helpful for us to be able to compare the different brands and see what would work best for us.

Latex was really thick, really snug (a bit too snug, and in all modesty, I'm not well-endowed). Girlfriend liked them, can't say the same for myself. No babies, so that's always a plus.

            "\n  This is I and my husbands favorite condom for pregnancy prevention! Easy to use, fit is good, transfers heat faster, and way more comfortable for both of us because it is not stiff/rubbery like the others. Comes with great instructions if that is a plus for anyone :) Not sure why people make a big deal out of the smell. I can't even tell unless I put it right up to my nose and even then it is very mild. Highly recommend for you to try! It is way cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I can find. We bought a pack of three at Walgreens to try them before we bought the big pack. The pack of 3 at Walgreens cost over 15 dollars! I couldn't believe it! Over 5 bucks per condom, and just over 2 dollars on Amazon. Thanks for the great product at a great deal!\n", 
            "\n  i gave this a 5 star rating because it allows the user the most pleasurable sensation a condom can ever produce.  It is, by far, the most quality Condom because you actually feel like you do not have a Condom on at all.  And would especially recommend it to those who find orgasm quite difficult with other, more thicker Condoms.\n", 
            "\n  Having 3 kids, 1 of which is 6 weeks old my wife and I are in no hurry for another one. We have looked at tons of options but I don't want a vasectomy and neither of us wants her on some jacked up pharmaceutical conconction to prevent birth so we opted for condoms. Disafisfied by how they feel we have tried a ton of them and settled on Skyn because I thought that was as good as it could get. After doing a bit of research online I found these and thought I would give them a try so I went to my local CVS to buy a 3 pack just to give them a go before buying in bulk. We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price. I will never go back to regular condoms. Doesn't protect against STDs but you shouldnt be out screwing some random chick anyways. Take it from someone who has lived both scenes. Married sex is way better than random sex. Hands down.\n",

            "\n  I've used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don't roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a \"choking\" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren't so damn tight. For reference I'm about 8.5\" long and 2\" wide (6.25\" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can't believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don't dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don't feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I'm guessing that's because they are the \"thin\" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you're not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I'd say if you're over about 7\" long or 6\" around (1.75\" wide) you should definitely give these a try.", 
            "FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn't have a single one rip, so I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I'm guessing since they're the \"thin\" version maybe if you don't have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.\n",

While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried.",

However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4\" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.  Also, the Magnum Ecstasy version I tried had \"Warming and Tingling, Nonoxynol-9\" that left me feeling disconnected from the experience.",

Magnum is my brand because they don't strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should've been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn't enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it's a little snug at the base....It doesn't seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I'm not going to be the guy who says it feels like there's nothing on.  I mean, let's be honest:  If you're wearing a condom, sex isn't as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: \"Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.\"  I thought so as well.  It is definitely thinner, and to put it courteously, fun was had by all.  If you need to wear a larger condom and you actually want to feel like you're having sex with a woman, then this is your condom.\n"

My wife and I tried this condom while we went on vacation, and we were very pleasantly surprised -- it's very comfortable for me, and when she goes down on me after sex, she likes it because I don't smell like latex. We didn't have a single breakage with over 20 used, and our longest use was about an hour and a half or so.",

It does run a little bit smaller than other brands, but just enough that I noticed it and not so much felt uncomfortable. If you go on their website, they also have trial sizes for sale so you can find your size before you buy.\n",

            "And then there was 1 extra one, that was just on its own, which I thought was a little weird? Why not just 24? Why not just 26?. But maybe they had some sort of idea with that, or just adding a little bonus..",

            "\n  This is my second purchase of the 25 pack and let me tell you, it's been a busy 11 days since I first tried them.  These Jimmy's are amazing.  If you are a guy who loves to raw dog but always feels bad or scared after you hit it with no jimmy, then these are for you.  Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.  I hit the skins at least 4 times a week and I could practically be a spokesperson for these Jimmy's because I've used them so much.\n", 
            "\n  Best condoms I have ever bought. They are easily the favorite for my boyfriend and me, They fit him super comfortably and we only ever had one incident of them breaking (we forgot to use lube first). Super comfortable for him and me.\n", 
            "\n  I'm giving it 1 star because I'm not sure what I received this time and I need answers. I previously ordered Skyn Large condoms in May 2016 and i fell in love with them. I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.", 
            "In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the \"S\" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says \"TM\" and the other \"R\". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India. Can I get answers as to whether they are counterfeit or real?", 
            "Thanks\n", 
            "\n  I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these \"plastic condoms\" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, \"this is the kind you have to use,\" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.\n"

            "Here's my review, first off, I didn't purchase from Amazon. I got it from condomdepot .com. I purchased a 24 pack ($9.99), googled for a discount, found one at 12% off, and used the free priority shipping.  It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk. I searched for the best price before I purchased, even looked here, and I felt the price there was already pretty good, add the free shipping and the discount and my mine was made.", 
            "Now as far as use goes, I thought the condom looked smaller than other condoms, but it slipped right on my sweetie with no problems. I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything. I got these condoms for HIM, because I wanted us to be protected but I wanted him to be able to feel as much as possible. I also noticed that there was no latex and sex smell after we were done.",

If you're not ready to bring new life into this world because you have toys to buy and places to see...stick to Trojan or Durex.\n", 
            "\n  These are great condoms for the price. Between my wife and I, we go through a lot of them and I love being able to buy these in bulk. I have never had one burst on me. The lubrication is not that great so make sure you have some good lube on hand.\n", 
            "\n  Amazon has the best cheapest price on these condoms. I love the feel of them. They fit well and they don't smell like some condoms do. I'm always buying this brand whenever I run out. This is the cheaper version to those condoms that are like .002 or .003 or .004 sizes.\n",

I moved away from Trojans because they always felt too thick and gave off a bad smell. Durex was my preferred brand but they got more and more expensive. These feel thinner than both brands (which I worry about) but I have yet to have one fail on me.\n", 
            "\n  These used to be my favorite condoms. Either I've changed or they have but these used to be a perfect fit and now they're too snug, too stiff, and overall, just not comfortable to wear. Go get free condoms somewhere. Don't waste your money on awful, uncomfortable condoms.\n", 
            "\n  I don't want to unnecessarily scare anyone, but my husband and I had used more expensive name-brand condoms (Trojan and Durex) for the past 7 years with complete success.  Within a month of switching to these, one broke.  I'm currently 11 weeks pregnant.  Could it have been a coincidence?  Yes.  Could another brand of condom have broken?  Of course.  And I'm excited for the new baby and all...but I will NOT be relying on these again in the future.\n"

Never again will I be in line at Wal-Mart with nothing but a pregnancy test and 6 pack of beer; making deep eye contact with the cashier. Maybe next time I'll buy a hundred. Who knows, Amazon lets me let my freak flag fly in the name of safety and emotional well being of retail associates.\n",

The Lifestyles Skyn Intense Feel Condom is now my first choice every time. Thank you for creating a product so well designed that actually delivers. It is even better than using no condom at all. It really does heighten\u200b the experience for both partners.\n", 
            "\n  all of a sudden, I became allergic to latex condoms, so I needed to find a non-latex condom that I liked.  These condoms are great.  I like the extra ribbing on these, it feels good to me, and my partner says the condoms feel good for him too.\n",

The intense feel ones in particular feel much thinner and more pleasurable than the regular or large ones. I've also found them to be more stretchy or perhaps in between the regular and large size since larger partners who couldn't get the regular ones on could use these, and I've also never had an issue with them slipping off smaller partners.\n",

I also recieved two extra lubrication packets, a dental dam, and a \"pen light\" that my niece loves to play with(a pretty usable flashlight on a pen). Haha. I would say the flavors lack, but the smells are believable. I recently gave fellatio with Mint and it is possible for them for orgasm with one on. Might not be as great, but at least he did. Shipping is also very discrete. I received my package under GHP records and sales company. Something along those lines. Could also be used as a dental dam, (unroll, cut the tip off, and one cut along the condom length wise to get one sheet out of it).  I probably would not recommend for sexual intercourse, maybe as last resort with spermicides(or second contraceptive) along with. They are also colored condoms. I would say 12 flavored condoms for $6 is worth trying if you are into experimenting with safe foreplay/sex. If you want a strong, distinct flavor, you might want to look elsewhere or into flavored lube packets. These got a good laugh from the colors and smells. \"wtf, Cola?\"\n",

            "\n  I was a little bit scared buying a brand of condoms I had never heard of but I took a shot and was really pleased. I've never had one break on me and they really are thin. I'm fairly thick down there and have also not had any problems with that.", 
            "Furthermore, I have used these and extra thin Trojan condoms back to back and they were virtually identical experiences.\n", 
            "\n  These are thin as advertised so the feeling is nice. Packaging is easy to open, which makes an awkward situation less so.", 
            "However , when they say lightly lubricated they aren't joking. If you (ladies you can by them too) or your lady... how to say this... naturally generate copious quantities of friction reducing secretions from your genital area, you will be fine. If you are average to lower on that scale get some lube with these or go with a different brand.", 
            "Also, they are blue. Was kind of unexpected for my lady when I turned around and it was blue. Personally at that point it could be hot pink and have Hello Kitty on it for all I care. She was happy with the feel of it and how thin they were but a smurf joke or two was had.", 
            "Overall good product but needs a little more lubricant.\n", 
            "\n  I have had Trojan break many times and a few Durex but not these. Strongest condoms I have ever tried. Only one broke on me but only because I was trying to see how strong they were. They are also the thinnest I have tried, I don't feel them at all. Which makes their price even better. The one problem is lightly lubricated is a massive understatement. You WILL need extra lube.\n", 
            "\n  Love it! I will forevermore buy Okamoto Beyond Seven condoms in packs of 50! They are great quility and stretch pretty big, I haven't been able to break one yet, short of using a needle to poke them. They came in the mail within a few days, every time I've bought this product I've bought on a Thursday/Friday and it gets here about Monday. I love it! Very satisfied customer.\n", 
            "\n  My wife and I have tried several condoms and have found this one to be the most comfortable for the both of us.  Since condoms are a matter of personal preference, I can only say that I would recommend you give it a try to rule it out for yourselves -- but we consider this our go-to condom of choice.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms are some of the best I've ever tried. I take girls home from the bars and clubs all the time and these work great! I don't know why people keep complaining of the lack of lubricant on these as they are lubed quite well compared to the skinless skins inside and out which makes them feel very comfortable. I also like the bluish tint they have to them it adds to the fun and it's better than the off/dull white that most other condoms have. One of the best things about these that I love is the fit as these are probably the best fitting condoms I've ever tried before. I'm a little over 7\" fully erect and they cover me up just fine without being too restrictive. They are nice and snug border line too snug but just enough to give your member some breathing room which makes me feel safe that it's staying in place and not going anywhere no matter how hard the party gets. For sensitivity I can honestly say that I can't tell I'm wearing one when going at it which makes me not mind using a condom which I like because we all know that using a condom sucks. I can definitely tell the difference between the sheerlon and the regular latex condoms. These sheerlon condoms are smoother and stretch without the restricting feeling of regular latex. I've never had one break on me even when the going was rough and dry. I'm glad I tried these because these are my go to condom for casual encounters and I would probably be paying at least two girls child support and maybe of had a few STD's if I wouldn't have used these. And you can't beat the price either, they're cheaper than Trojan and Durex and feel way better.\n", 
            "\n  These won the top vote in a personal fit test of a variety of condoms, and they have the added benefit of being ridiculously cheap. They've never slipped or failed. My go-to choice. They're packaged in a clear plastic bag.\n", 
            "\n  Beyond Seven is the best for sensation and reliability.  But I knew that already.  When ordering in quantity like this, expiry is what matters.  I just received my order and expiration was in 2019.  GOOD!\n"

I emailed Lifestyles to find out if that's how they wrap ultra sensitive for bulk purchases. If not, I'll be returning these.

I've had 2 of this package break on me, but we did probably use it longer than intended.  I've never had a broken condom previous to these.  Overall I still love them.\n",

When I wrote to Glyde, they immediately sent me a box of their ultra thin condoms (and some flavored condom testers!). Needless to say, I was very impressed with their customer support. Moreover, I was very happy with the condoms they sent me. There was no latex smell, it lasted well over an hour without breaking, and the lubricant somehow doesn't get sticky after a while like most condom lubricants do. My wife was actually really happy about it too, since when she went down on me after sex, she didn't have to deal with the latex smell.",

The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9\".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don't seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don't have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you're rolling in the dough.",

            "\n  I had been using Trojan condoms for years because they're just the gold standard, but I never tried different sizes. I got some magnums but those were (WAY) too big for me. If you're above average downstairs but not huge then these condoms should work nicely. Never had one break and I've gone through two 50-packs over the past year. Nice feel to them. Very good product.\n", 
            "\n  This latex free product can be hard to find, so do yourself a favor and buy the 50 count that is available on Amazon as well. The size is good, not that long for some reason but that doesn't seem to matter as much as the width part. My partner is large sized, and I am sensitive to latex so this is what I found that works for us. This product is not available locally, and what lady wants to buy a 50 count box of large sized condoms, not in my area....thanks Amazon for discretion, and useful products\n", 
            "\n  If you (or your guy) find regular sized and/or latex condoms uncomfortable, Skyn Large is a great alternative - they're non-latex (but stretchier than polyeurethane condoms), and are comfortable for men who are particularly... blessed below the waist. Even if you don't have latex sensitivities, these are worth giving a try.\n", 
            "\n  Ladies, if you have a latex allergy than these are just the thing. For a long time it thought I had a mild infection of some kind, turns out it was a mild latex allergy. Not a fun place for itching and burning ;)!\n", 
            "\n  Just so you know, the expiration date on my order was June, 2014. As you can see from the wrapper, that these are not the same as the ones currently on the shelf in the brick & mortar stores. Same brand, just older.\n",

Girth is an issue in a lot of condoms, and while these still leave a bit of a dent after we're done, they don't seem to affect my wife at all and a happy wife is a happy life. If you're too girthy down stairs, you will probably start to lose sensitivity after a few minutes. If we go longer than 10 minutes, there's a definite decline in feeling. As other reviews have stated, definitely buy in bulk as they are hard (if not impossible) to find locally.\n",

I would take a few for one of my nephews each week -- just in case. A couple of months ago I learned that my younger nephew had become sexually active and was going away to Camp.  I know, I  know, camp.  Anyway, one morning I received a text from my older nephew asking me if I'd get him more condoms.  He too was going away.  I hastened to find a good quality condom and scoured the Amazon website reading all of the reviews, etc. I finally decided to go with Lifestyes Luscious Flavors 100 Pack because it obviously had been working.  It was due to arrive in a couple of days, which would have been on a Friday. The boys were leaving Saturday!  I received a notice from Lifestyles apologizing that they would not be arriving on time with apologies.  Much to my surprise and delight, the package arrived Saturday morning before they left!  Awesome!  I do not condone immature sexual activity, but I believe in safety first!\n",

            "\n  I thought these flavored condoms would give me an infection like so many do, but these were recommended to me by a friend and she was right. Nice subtle flavor and no infection after using them several times. TMI, but these guys work well.\n",

Not only are the condoms far superior to the main three brands on the market, this is a company with a serious global mission. If you don't know already, the people at L. Condoms report that they give away one condom for every one that they sell, and they give them away in a poor African nation where condoms are hard to find and impossible for many to afford. So by buying these condoms, you're helping others -- and that's cool.", 
            "But what about the condoms themselves? These are designed in a whole new way, using pure latex and simple lubricant that is very neutral. If you or your partner are allergic to latex, clearly these are not for you -- but really, that is the only potential problem I can see with these. This ribbed version, if you're into that kind of thing, is ribbed but not aggressively so; the ribbing is subtle.", 
            "As you can see in one of my images, I inflated one of the condoms to a high pressure to see if it leaked. The condom hold the air for over ten minutes before I popped it, proving that these are well made a leak proof.", 
            "These are classy condoms with an urban, cool feel to the packaging. Really, I can't imagine a cooler condom from a cooler company.",

When I tell them they are extra strength, it seems to give them the go ahead to push harder and deeper knowing there is less risk of breaking inside me.  Of course since it knocks down some of the sensation, some of these guys go until I'm weak and helpless.  As someone who enjoys the company of strangers, these put my mind at ease knowing that there is less risk of catching a social disease and I am free to open myself up to new driving styles.",

So whether you like it anally or vaginally, giving it or taking it, these condoms help your date last longer and give you that extra pinch of assurance so you don't have to worry as much about sharing fluids with that stranger from Craigslist.\n",

I don't think we will ever be able to go back to any other condoms. While nothing is better than actually wearing nothing, this is very, very close. I seriously recommend giving them a try. You will not be disappointed.\n",

There have been a few occasions I've wondered if it slipped off when it was still firmly attached. I'm not sure if that's because it's a great condom or because I drink too much. Either way, it's not terrible, in my book that makes this an excellent way to prevent syphilis and baby momma's.\n",

I feared that I would never be able to use a condom and practice safe sex. My doctor suggested latex alternative and I decided to look up the best brand and give that a try. And boy do these do the trick! I am glad for my allergy because I was able to discover these bad boys. They are amazing and I use nothing else! Much cheaper on here than in stores. So stock up!\n",

It doesn't irritate me, it actually provides some relief. Being on birth control has made my fluids a bit more uncomfortable for intercourse unless i'm extremely wet. It's almost like it's more thin and watered down and it makes it easier to irritate me than normal. By having no ridges or bumps, it is really nice for when i'm feeling a bit more sensitive down there. My significant other likes these condoms better than most types, but of course says skin on skin is better( you can't really ever have it same now can you?)  It stays it shape once on and doesn't slide off. I've also never once had this type break on me and i've been using it for quite some time now.\n",

I found the Trojan: Bareskin, and it works perfectly, but I keep finding online posts where people said they had them rip; THAT IS THE LAST THING I WANT! I tried the original Lifestyles: SKYN, and I still had a hard time ejaculating, and then I tried these. The SKYN Extra-Lubricated  is a HUGE step up from the original! It feels very smooth on the shaft, and has completely eliminated that rubber-band feel that latex condoms have. It still takes a little longer to ejaculate, but when I do it feels awesome. It is not the same as a Trojan: Bareskin, because it feels different; these are two totally different types of condoms. The great news is that I have heard no read no posts of these ripping; that news alone is enough to make one ejaculate with joy.",

My husband and I are not looking to have another baby just yet so while I am not on any BC pill we thought it would be wise to play it safe. We hardly use condoms and hate the smell and feel so I put in the research and decided to give these SKYN condoms a try and I don't think we will ever try another brand. No smell and for me it doesn't feel like he's wearing anything. He's mentioned that they are a little tight but that hasn't seemed to affect him.\n",

Aside from that, it's still a 5 star product. Easy to open since all sides are designed to be able to be teared open. The only issue, that can be personally fixed, is the lubricant amount.

Akward, slippery, and not even close to being easy to insert.

            "Main concern with these is how easy they might be to break because of how thin they are but so far even with rough sex, none have broken and they seem well made. These fit a bit tighter than Durex condoms so that might be a concern.",

That almost nothing on the box was no joke. You could even barely tell I had one on looking at it. Its also strong too. I have used a few and I had no issue.

On paper, yes, but in actual use I didn't really notice much of a difference. First thing my wife said, though: \"These don't smell bad at all!\" That was always a deal-breaker for Trojan and even LifeStyles, the latex stench. You couldn't get the smell off your fingers until two or three washings later. Okamoto's lines are definitely better, but even the Crown smelled a little bit. 004 might be a game changer there.  :)",

If I find anything wrong with these (durability, etc) I'll update this, but as for now I'd probably spring for these over Crowns. I mean, yeah, they're more expensive by double, but I'm married; I'm not using 20 a month (though I'd like to). It's not like they're $10/shot.",

The design of them is best suited for someone with a bigger girth, otherwise they'll feel 'loose' as some reviewers mention. I never had a problem with breakage. The best of Trojan brand - I love them so much, I'm having a friend bring me more as they're not sold in London (where I currently reside). Durex has nothing comparable.\n",

Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you. This will create friction inside and friction is feeling. With a normal condom you have to rely on stretching to create this friction. The tapered end should hold securely onto the base (if your sized right), but I would test things out solo to make sure there are no surprises.\n",

That is sad, because they are a really good idea. The female condom is a larger verson of the male condom, designed to be inserted into the vagina, and have the male penetrate in the usual fashion. There is a semi-solid but flexible ring at the closed (internal) end that helps keep the female condom in place during sex.", 
            "As a male, I don't particularly like male condoms. I realize they are good for safe sex, okay but not great for birth control, inexpensive, and widely available. However, they do have some serious limitations. First and foremost, they are not very comfortable. It has been pointed out, accurately IMHO, that male condoms can even be troublesome for men built larger than average, and that includes the larger  condoms. They can be quite uncomfortable, interfere with an erection, and be difficult to put on.", 
            "Second, they do interfere with sexual pleasure. The male organ, unlike its female counterpart, is far more sensitive to stimulation by friction than by warmth, pressure, or vibration. Male condoms seriously decrease stimulation by friction (which can be great if you need that). The old saw about \"showering in a raincoat\" is not far wrong.", 
            "The female condom solves both these problems. They are far more comfortable, especially for the \"bigger\" man, and they allow the male to experience the frictional stimulation that works best for him. They also allow the female to have control over the use of the condom, preserve the primary mechanics of stimulation for her as well, and can be far more fun to insert than a male condom is to put on.",

I had seen what I'd say are about 2/3 to 3/4 positive reviews at all the sites I've looked at, and a substantial number of negative reviews, again around 1/4 to 1/3. I knew already that what was pictured here was an FC1, and what is being sold is an FC2--so heads up that packaging is not as pictured (at the time of my purchase), and that's GOOD because you want the FC2, not the FC1. The later version has improvements including that it doesn't make the crinkly bag sound a lot of folks complained about. I had watched the instructional videos about insertion, and also read at the informational sites that you should try it about 3 times with self-insertion (I'm a woman), before you should be getting the hang of inserting them. My partner was very into the idea of inserting it himself, and I had no objection. When I tried on my own at home, I felt very unsure if I'd seated it/secured it as required. But when he did it--also after watching the video online--he nailed it the first time. I wonder if most of the negative reviews are tied to older versions (FC1) or not inserting it properly, because that thing was anchored in there securely and we had no trouble with it moving or coming out. It stayed put exactly as intended, and we did a number of stops and starts with the one we used. For my part of it, I really didn't even notice it. It felt like \"nothing.\" At one point we were just laying in bed, and he asked how it felt just laying there with it in. I said I couldn't even notice it. When we removed it, I did feel the tug, which let me know it was in tight while we were using it, and had been inserted properly. For his experience, the jury is still out.

Very slippery to insert and pretty unsexy hanging out, but if you and your partner are both game to try it and can get over that, you will be amazed!  The male has to make sure to aim appropriately into the ring, or it obviously can't do its job.  So, you have to re-aim every time he comes completely out. If you don't check, it is easy to slip around it and be outside without knowing it.",

She has an adverse reaction to birth control, and I am not ready to get snipped just yet, so we decided condoms were best.  Trojans, lifestyles, durex, and other all seem to leave something to be desired.  These ONE brand condoms solved that problem, they just have the right fit and feel.  They are super comfortable and the sex feels amazing.  I highly recommend trying these out!\n", 
            "\n  I bought these for the novelty and a few laughs (there's a glow-in-the-dark condom). Each of the normal condoms were way too thick and were immediately discarded. The sensitive ones were decent and the rest were so-so. Overall the packaging is a fun novelty that quickly wears off and just isn't worth the extra price. They do however work as condoms are supposed to work. So, that alone is worth three stars.\n",

I gave birth to my son a few weeks ago and even though I'm going to get a better birth control that's more convenient for us, in the mean time he has to wear a condom and these were amazing!

The flavored ones ended up being pretty useless as my girlfriend simply refuses to put that in her mouth and it 'eliminates the fun part'. Aren't as lucky as I am and your girlfriend loves the flavor? Treck on my friends. Be smart, be safe: blackout and buy these at 2 am like I did and surprise your lucky lady two short days later with a long lasting  pleasure\n", 
            "\n  This fell far short of expectations. First, I wanted novelty condoms (studs, ribs, glow in the dark, etc), but all I got were \"sensitive\" ones in weird packaging. The only one out of the ordinary was the one with a large tip. Other than that, they were all the same. Second, these are not good as far as condoms go. The material is thick, the packages are hard to open, and the condoms themselves are tight and uncomfortable to unroll.\n",

I took a star off, because I'm not sure if they're effective as we haven't actually opened one, but they're serving their purpose as a novelty for now.\n",

With ONE condom's there is more contact and sensation. The package is cool. It is perfectly lubricated. As a woman, they feel amazing inside me and they do not smell terrible and neither does the lube. The lube doesn't dry as fast as the Trojan one's, and there is less friction and burning than the trojan condom. BEST CONDOM EVER!!!

So the female condom works wonders and my partner says its way better than a regular condom. These are very expensive but worth it for my situation in the long run. Haven't noticed odor in between sex with these like I was with male condoms.\n", 
            "\n  They do work, but aren't the most natural thing in the world. Keeping them in place can also be an issue. Five came in the package and three are left. Even with plenty of lube... One ripped and the other kept \"attaching\" to my member, so it was more like a male condom.\n", 
            "\n  A guy here.  I can't feel a thing wearing a condom.  These are a little more awkward (they hang out of her a little bit), but I can actually feel sensation due to the friction.  The closest thing I've felt to not wearing protection at all.  Great!\n",

They are not as lubricated as most condoms, which gives you the option to use your preferred lubricant without much extra mess. They are on the smaller side and a snug fit, but one might argue that it reduces any slippage during intercourse and thereby increases the sensation. We didn't take issue with it. The packaging is nice and discreet if you happen to pop one in your purse or pocket. ;)\n",

I love the product and have subsequently recommended it to my friends. Really like the brand focus and messaging, as well as the focus on sustainable sourcing. prefer this to the normal things I find at a convenience store. Feels better, and I myself feel better knowing it has an added focus on the environment. with so many other products moving this way, seems overdue that condoms and sexual health products would as well.\n",

They work just as well (if not better because of the peace of mind) than traditional brands like Trojan and Durex. Next time I\u2019m at Whole Foods I\u2019m definitely going to pick a pack up. --Katy Foley\n"

You can't use oil-based lubricants (such as coconut oil) with latex.\n",

            "\n  The Okamoto 004 is the best overall Latex condom I have come across so far. It basically fits like a regular US condom while being thinner at 0.04. The few condoms in this range in the US such as the Trojan Bareskin and Durex Avanti Bare Latex at about 52mm were way too tight at the base ring. The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower. As of now in 2014 the main Latex condom I personally buy is the Okamoto 004.\n",

These where very well packaged. Not that is matters. The fit was great, no funky plastic odors, and where very durable. My wife said they felt amazing, almost like I wasn't wearing one. So that's what really matters. I would recommend these. While they are a little pricey they are one of the best condoms I have ever tried.\n",

They are more like a hint of flavor -which I like-  without any \"plastic\" or weird taste.  Excellent for oral sex and finishing without a mess. My husband and I love them.\n",

One thing that I'd mention is that if you are a 'gifted' man, these are probably going to be a little tight for you...not going to cut off circulation or anything, but definitely a little bit snug.\n",

I had discussed it with my girlfriend and we decided to go with these but you would expect to get 2 of each flavor but instead you get a random number of each. Even then, the \"flavors\" are more like scents, good scents but there's no taste to them. I guess its a flavor for your partner's nose...a condom for nose holes. I wouldn't know what else to compare it to since I haven't tried any other brands with \"flavors\"\n",

            "\n  Condoms came exactly as described. The flavor is a bit weak but is significantly better than plain condoms. They are a bit tight for me but I'm much thicker than most and somewhat prefer a tight condom. I bought these because my GF doesn't like the taste of the \"fluids\" that I produce so we used normal condoms and the taste of latex and the lube also wasn't so enjoyable for her. Better but not very good. These solve those problems completely. Would definitely recommend\n"

We have gone through a few hundred of them and have never had one break, and I have never gotten pregnant. The price is right and they come quickly (no pun intended).\n",

There is nothing worse than having your condom fall off!  They also do not have a strong smell, and they do not make my penis smell bad either, which I have experienced with other condoms.",

The package arrived quickly and was very discreet - it was in a yellow bubble wrap envelope with no identifying information on it. I'm not embarrassed about buying condoms, but I still appreciate the discretion. The expiration dates were several years into the future, which was very reassuring, since in the back of my mind I thought that maybe they were so cheap because they were about to expire, but that definitely wasn't the case. I haven't had a single breakage/issue with any of them, and I will definitely be reordering soon (unless I can convince my husband to have a vasectomy, which would be awesome.) If have any questions about these, I'm happy to help, and if you found this review helpful, I'd appreciate it if you consider letting me know below.\n",

I was a little reluctant because these are so cheap for such a big quantity, but I can assure you that if you are using them correctly, you'll have no problems. He likes them, I like them, we saved money. All is well.",

            "\n  No guy likes to wear condoms, That's A Fact !  However , these are truely the most sensitive condoms that I have ever tried . From my teens up until getting married , I used many different styles of Trojan condoms because that was the big name in condoms . Some were like wearing a balloon and some were not bad .I finally settled on the ribbed because it was better for her . Then after a 12 year relationship without condom use , I'm back on the dating scene . After my current girlfriend asked \" why are you buying condoms from the drug store ?\" , she suggested Lifestyles and buying online . I bought a variety pack from Amazon and I liked the ultra sensitive the best . I wish these were around when I was a teen . She tells me that on her end, that she doesn't notice much difference .\n",

As some reviewers have noted, the condoms fit a bit snugly, but I have no issues with the fit and actually prefer a snug fit for both, comfort and sensitivity. This is the first time I've tried this brand and will likely make my prefered choice going forward.\n",

These Sustain condoms are made without any harmful chemicals, designed with all natural materials and lubrication. The manufacturer also donates a portion of profits to women's health initiatives. For anyone truly concerned about their health and the health of their partner it is a good idea to choose natural condoms like these. You will probably find that these are just as comfortable if not more comfortable than the mainstream brands, and the extra cost is worth it since you are less likely to experience any irritation or allergic reaction to these relative to the ones that have synthetic chemicals.\n",

            "\n  I've tried all sorts of condoms, including Okamoto Polyurethane 0.02's as well as Okamoto Latex 0.03's. These are by far my favorite. They're not as thin as the Okamoto's but they're much cheaper and feel almost as good. There is a good amount of lube at the tip which means that during sex, the tip slides around more freely which replicates the sensation of condomless sex. These are thinner than the Crown Skinless Skin Condoms that are pretty popular.", 
            "Bottom line: These give you the best \"bang\" for your buck ;)\n", 
            "\n  I used my Ex's Amazon account bought these condoms to try it out. It was a pleasant surprise how good these are compared with the cost. These came with bulk package without the original boxes, but quality seems to be fine as each individual packing is marked manufactured in Japan, so it is probably better than some other brand that is moved to China or Thailand for manufacturing. I have tried Okamoto Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's and Okamoto Latex 0.03's.  The 0.01 is the best at a cost of $3.5 each and I truly can't feel the condom when it is on. I almost just about cannot feel the existence of the 0.02 and 0.03 either, both at about $1.5 each. These Kimono at about $0.40 a piece and feels almost as good as the Okamoto 0.03 with all the condoms I tried so far. Many people feel Kimono is on the small side, and that is really nothing we can do about it, but I am average size and feel it is good enough, specially the thinness make you almost forget it is on anyway. But the Aqua Lube does feel different to other general lubes although it is not bad.", 
            "For the Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's, now these are really really thin and small and very difficult to put it on, because they lack the stretch-ability of latex, so don't think Kimono Micro Thin is difficult to put it on. Even at that, once Polyurethane 0.01's, 0.02's are on and warmed up, they feel great, really like nothing is there. Based on what I know, Kimono Micro Thin Aqua Lube is 0.044 mm thick, Okamoto 0.03 is acutally 0.038, and the Polyurethane 0.01 is 0.018 thick and 002 is 0.028 thick, all in mm. Sagami have similar product like Okamoto but they are all similar in price and thickness, so I assume they feel similar. Chinese Aoni has a 0.01 Latex material condom that is actually 0.036mm in thickness at about $1.50 a piece on Amazon that I haven't tried. So overall, I feel these Kimono are good enough and have the best value out there.\n", 
            "\n  My Japanese girlfriend gave me one of these after mine broke...suffice to say that she provided the condoms thereafter.  These are better - by far - than anything...anything...I've ever tried at home in the U.S. They are strong and thin and tight and comfortable...even for larger appendages. During hours of use I never had a break or a slip-off...not even during the finale...All good...and", 
            " they are so light you won't even know you're wearing one...Excellent\n", 
            "\n  I almost feel like 3 stars is a bit harsh. These are comfortable and fit well, and are certainly an upgrade from any other brand I've tried.", 
            "But honestly, go with the regular, red-color kimonos. The \"aqua-lube\" that comes on these feels... weird. Like a dry, sticky feeling, even though it's not dry or sticky. It works really well, but it's just a weird feeling.\n", 
            "\n  Best condoms ever.", 
            "I used to use the Durex ultra sensitive (purple color), which were very high quality. I was told about these by a friend and now I can honestly say i've used about 1000 of these.. I've never had one break... no leakage...", 
            "Obviously when you are buying condoms, you don't want a trashbag... this is not a trashbag... Also I don't want any STI's or unwanted pregnancies.", 
            "Thank the lord (knock on wood) this condom has not failed me!", 
            "The only complaint that I have is the lube does run out after about 20 minutes or so (depending) so additional lubricant makes the world of the difference.", 
            "Kimono... Thank you !\n", 
            "\n  These were tight fitting but thin. They worked nicely. I am a little larger than average, but not thick. These are made in Asia for slimmer necklines (if you know what I mean). They hold up to normal friction. I wasn't brave enough to try rough play with these though. I definitely noticed a difference in the feel.\n", 
            "\n  BEST one out there and for the price is excellent. I have been using this for years and this is by far the best ones for the price. It is very durable for the thinness. Little bit snugged but I like it the way it is.\n",

            "Size L is actually just regular size, it's comparable to crown size, but because it's not latex, it's less stretchable. However, it held up quite nicely, had no smell (and very little lube). The packaging it comes in is very chic, and each condom come wrapped in a nice plastic container, similar to daily disposable contacts. These are definitely premium condoms and look the part. Huge fan now!\n", 
            "\n  Noticeably different than a latex condom, inflexible.  None have ripped thus far, which is great.  Transfers heat well.  It seems like the large is the size to go with if you are in the 6\"-7.5\" range with a \"typical\" girth, whatever that is.  My go to at this point, followed by Kimono and Crown.\n",

Trojan ENZ are 7.5\"X2\" but those are latex, elastic, stretchable, Sagami are not, or not so much, they're either gonna be too tight or too loose, if you're lucky they'll fit you perfectly.", 
            "Thickness of these are 0.02mm, the reason they're so thin is because they are made of polyurethane, the closest latex condom thickness are Okamoto's 003 at 0.03mm, 004 at 0.04mm, Kimono MicroThin and Trojan Bareskin at 0.045mm. Trojan Supra are made of polyurethane also but they're at 0.04mm thick, rather go latex, fits better. Latex at this thickness has more chances to break than polyurethane, most latex condoms are around 0.07mm thick.",

            "\n  These small penis condoms are excellent! I have finally found a condom that fits and does not slip off! Thanks so much for offering a much needed product. I would recommend these to anyone who has found that just like their is a need for extra large Magnum condoms there is also a need for extra small. I only wish I could find these condoms in greater quantities and not just a pack of three. I don't use them as often as I'd like, but it still gets expensive when I do and have to special order them 3 at a time. I also wish these extra small condoms would be carried in the regular drug stores like CVS, Rite Aid, Walmart, etc. so I could buy these off the shelf. There are a lot more of us smaller guys out there than people think. Thanks again for a very important and excellent product!.\n",

Polyurethane doesn't have much stretch so they're going to feel a bit tighter; that said, the feeling is a lot better.  I'd say if your member is on the low range of the suggested size for a Trojan magnum, then that's the maximum size then these will fit for you comfortably.", 
            "The good: It's probably the closest to not wearing a condom feel you can get.  This was an issue the first few times I used them because I thought it slipped off.  I've never had an issue with slippage though.  Heat transfer is great.  It's thin so you'll feel a lot more.", 
            "The bad: They don't roll incredibly easy compared to other condoms.  Practice with one before the first time you're with your partner to save some embarrassment.  I also wish there was a better reservoir tip; breakage hasn't been an issue but a better tip would be nice.  They are tight due to being polyurethane; it's really a personal preference if they're too tight for you.",

While I do not have a latex allergy, I find that latex condoms irritate my conditions. Additionally, I typically can't tolerate the lubricants that come on condoms, but I could not find a non-latex, non-lubricated condom. After doing some research, I discovered that polyurethane condoms are superior to polyisoprene because they can conduct temperature better and are thinner. I decided to give these a try despite the lubricant and found that I tolerate them very well. My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to \"bare back\" sex than any other condom and I don't have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI's afterward. Also, I can use non-water based lubricants that I find more effective and gentle and not worry about compromising the integrity of the condom. We won't use any other condom now.\n",

I agree with other reviewers that these are a tight fit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Better tight than loose.  Anyway, good price and product, prompt delivery and good communication.\n",

Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.",

Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.",

            "\n  FINALLY!!!  I found a truly extra extra large condom that fits me without strangling me!  AND, a really straight forward company that labels its condoms in straight forward measurements instead of lying with fake words like \"extra large\"  like Trojan and many others!  The Trojan Magnum XL is a joke, BARELY larger than the regular size,  The brand: \"ONE the Legend\"  is a SUPER joke, they say large, but REALLY tight!\n", 
            "\n  This is the best condom in the whole world in my opinion!  I am a large man in that area and everything else was like a choke fest, even Trojans Magnum extra large condoms are tight, although I wore if I had too.  I found these in Europe, but couldn't get them here, till I saw they were on amazon!  If you have this problem of feeling strangled, but you just grim and bear it, you will love these condoms.  Just a joy to put on and it gives you quite a ego boost as well, BUT, you must use the measuring tape and make sure you get the RIGHT size for you!\n", 
            "\n  Hallelujah! After years of being 'strangled' by ill-fitting condoms (and, frankly, hating them as a result), finally a condom that fits and doesn't get in the way. Too bad there's not a US distributor.\n", 
            "\n  AMAZING. I measured and found out why I always hated store condoms. I'm a 64 and they fit great, therefore feel great. it's like nothing at all. They're packaged in nice boxes and shipped quickly. I ordered a lot but I hope I will need to reorder.\n", 
            "\n  Finally a condom that fits! Honestly I had no idea what a condom is supposed to feel like. I am a little over 6\" in girth and a little over 7\" in length and these fit great. No slippage, no breakage, and no purple ring of death on your pecker. This condom makes all the difference.\n", 
            "\n  I am so glad I found these!!  I finally have a condom that doesn't squish me and reduce sensitivity. Sex is SOOOO much better with these on!! They fit great, feel good and are easy to use.  Their website has suggestions on how to measure yourself to determine what size is right for you.\n", 
            "\n  Finally! Condoms that don't leave me bruised and purple after a few minutes of use. For anyone with a 6\"-7\" girth, these are perfect.",

I would have liked to at least get some charged condoms in the box and less of the ecstasy.\n",

As a man, it's actually quite pleasurable and does seem to lead to a more intense climax.  Unfortunately I feel that something isn't quite right with the fit of the condom itself.  I would describe these condoms as feeling \"baggy\", and the ring at the base does not fit as snugly as most condoms.  This gave a feel that the condom was constantly slipping during sex.  I have never experienced this issue with other condoms, and I've tried many different brands, including other Trojans.  I would say I am average (or slightly above) in size, and usually condoms tend to feel slightly snug.  This is the first condom I've used that felt loose.  I don't know if this is intentional due to the special lubrication, but it was worrisome during sex.",

The lubricant gives a nice sensation for me, my boyfriend doesn't notice anything, but I don't thing its meant for him, more for the partner its used on. So I would give these a go for sure, and we've also never had any problems with them breaking or any other mishaps so they're great.\n",

            "\n  I love it! Tried Crown and Trojan Bareskin brands right before this. Wow, there is noticeable difference in thickness. I thought Crown thickness was nice but too tight. Aoni feels even thinner than Crown but actually stretches to a perfect form-fitting feeling, as they say, \"snug\", as if it was made just for my penis shape. The only gripe I have is the lubricant is too fragrant, although very nice to smell, like an apple or honeysuckle, but it's too distracting. But I do like the amount of lubricant, very nice, enough to cover the entire surface of the rolled out condom. I think I found my new favorite condom brand!\n", 
            "\n  I received this balloon animal making kit. I found the wide opening at the base of the balloons difficult to blow them up and hold air. Also  they have a very slick texture and the balloon kept sliding in and out of my hands and mouth I could not get  a good grip on them until finally the big moment came. I was able to get the first few twists in but then they cam undone so I ended up making a balloon sword instead but it looked more like a giant man part instead for some reason. Oh well maybe I should not try this by myself and get my husband to help me later with testing this product.",

My only quarry is with this condom and all others his helmet has a ridge that sticks up that I rather like and the tube shape of most condoms flattens that. So though these feel very natural skin to skin almost it does not allow for his shape to be his shape but we knew that going in. Maybe a suggestion for future products The helmeted hero design :-)",

            "\n  I'm not getting any younger, and need something with a bit more sensitivity than my usual Trojan Magnum XL.  Unfortunately these are much smaller than Magnum XL, despite the XL designation, and so are almost impossible to put on in the normal way.  Alternative is to partially unroll over two fingers from each hand, and then stretch it out and put on, slip out fingers, and unroll the rest.", 
            "The sensitive is pretty good - noticeable improvement over Magnum Bareskin and big improvement over Magnum XL.",

            "\n  Bought these and they're hard to get on and too small though they're labeled large. I'm a above average guy but not gargantuan. To make matters worse, in addition to being tight, these broke on the first use. Breakage happens sometimes so I didn't totally discount them but out of four, two of these broke. Threw the rest out as they're not worth the risk and worry. Definitely won't buy again. If you're above average in length and/or girth try the sagami large 002; I've used these awhile and they're pretty good especially if you put a drop or two of lubricant inside.\n", 
            "\n   They feel better than other condoms during sex, definitely thin. Kinda hard to unroll on because they are so thin and it gets caught in itself while unrolling it down, if you know what I mean. I am 8 inches long and 5.8 inches circumference. I emailed the company and they said they were 54mm wide. I dont know about that because Trojan Magnums are 54mm wide, and these were not the same size as a Magnum for sure. They weren't an uncomfortable fit but they could release and XXL size and they may be perfect. But I am a fan and these will be my go-to condoms from now on. Interchanging with a Trojan Magnum every so often, but the Aoni will be #1 because I prefer the feeling lol.\n",

I can honestly say that the product is fantastic.\n", 
            "\n  It is hard enough to convince yourself that condoms feel great, but these are actually a little better, not great, but better than other brands we have tried. The prices are pretty high compared to other brands, so that may be a factor on my next purchase.",

Despite being wrapped as if for children (Initially I thought they had mistakenly sent me a variety multi-pack but each was the same, just uniquely wrapped with a different humorous cartoon on it). They do seem to work though! Plenty of space at the head and not too snug along the shaft. Not loose either, so no worries of it falling off! So far used two of them and happy with results ;)",

These are horrible if you're in the heat of things and being a not so good looking guy, time is our biggest asset.

I'm glad I took a chance because these are the only condoms that have worked for us. My husband found them to be comfortable and he said there was enough room in the base and the head of the condom (which was his biggest complaint about other brands). They fit well, worked well and didn't cause a single issue in our sex life. They served their purpose for the 6 months they were needed and if they are ever needed again, this is definitely the brand I would continue to buy. I've recommended them to all of my girlfriends who have the same condom issues with their SOs as I had with mine and they all have thanked me continuously for the recommendation.",

The thing i didn't like was most of them felt a little slippery like one of them had a hole in and leaked out on them. I haven't found any like that and will update this if i do find one. The shipping was in a simple white bag with a clear bag of these inside. It wasn't damaged at all during shipping. Over all im happy with what i got. But since i usually buy bulk online from different brands and this is the only one that felt a little slippery like something got on some im taking one star off. I would still buy from here again.\n"

You can get 100 for around $16, that's 16 cents per condom which definitely isn't too shabby.\n",

I haven't had any problems sensitivity wise (but I do add extra lubricant). These come in a loose packaging (not the original box) so I was a little unsure at first at how safe they would be, but they've held up. Definitely one of my go to brands at this point and worth trying.\n", 
            "\n  Well this is definitely the first time I have ever reviewed a condom lol. I purchased these because there are nights when a condom is necessary. With that being said I would have to say that these are decent for the price. These condoms are not super thick and allow you to still have some feeling unlike other brands I have used in the past. My only complaint with these is that there could be a little more lubrication in the package. I feel that the lube is sparingly in these and after you put the condom on, the lube almost disappears. For the price and the amount that you get, I cannot complain. My wife and I use these on certain occasions and so far have not had any break so that is a plus. I would say that the quality is good and that they hold up as indicated. I would buy again!\n",

Have inflated two to check the quality. No problems at all. I love buying them in bulk so I can use as many as I need in one night.\n", 
            "\n  All I have to say is that I am sensitive to smells and most condoms make me think of hospital room when you catch a whiff and these while they carry a minor odor are notably less intoxicating and make me not disagreeable to wearing one.\n", 
            "\n  Bought these as an cheaper alternative. After looking around at others on Amazon, I decided on these and they have been great. Definitely feel thinner, haven't had any breaks so far, and no weird latex smell.\n", 
            "\n  They're a little tight to get on but the upside is they won't be coming off, they're super durable and sensitive. These are the first of five that I've been able to actually use for intercourse. Also $1.88 for a three pack at Walmart and even cheaper on here. All in all a great product. A little low on lubrication but works very well with a little KY gel\n", 
            "\n  They delivered 25 Lifestyle regulars, not Ultra Sensitives. Too snug, too thick, not great feeling. Both have the grey packaging but ultra sensitives have it written under LifeStyles.  Bait and switch or oversight, who knows, 1 star regardless.\n"

Condoms are regulated medical devices, so each regulator (the FDA in the US) specifies the standard of testing that every condom available for a US citizen to purchase in the US must satisfy. That's a great thing, and should be applauded. However.. the way the FDA specifies its testing (related to another body called the ASTM) means that only certain sizes are cleared for sale: length minimum 160mm, and nominal width 47-57mm (until 2008 this was 50-54mm, which is why Magnum is 54mm). Now in Europe, the medical regulator does exactly the same - dictates what tests any condom must pass before being allowed for sale to a European citizen (there are 500,000,000 people in Europe!).",

            "\n  The smell is awful. Almost made me sick. The regular Skyn condoms are awesome but these are terrible. My boyfriend said he liked the feel better, but I could not tolerate the smell. I also did not like the feel as well as the regular. We won't be using these again.\n",

They're supposedly 10% thinner and all that, but my guy didn't buy into all the hype since it obviously still feels like a condom. However, compared to other condoms we purchased with this, this was definitely the winner out of them all. The only con is that they are pretty pricey, so check out your local Bed Bath & Beyond because mine sells them for less than $6.00.\n",

I googled the non latex condoms before I bought these it also seemed a little weird but I am so glad I tried them because I really don't want to try any others u barely feel its there!\n",

My fianc\u00e9 reports that he is able to feel everything far better with these than any other \"barely there\" condom we've tried. These also have not broken on us... They hold up and are not over or under lubricated. Can't say enough good things honestly....\n",

            "Packaging: The outer cardboard packaging is nothing special, but solid enough to keep the inner cargo safe. Once out of the box, by gently squeezing the center of the individual condom packaging, you immediately appreciate the durable individual condom packaging. This packaging allows for safer transport, protecting the integrity of the condom.", 
            "Features: Honestly, I don't really notice \"much\" difference between these condoms, but I prefer to get this variety pack because there is a small enough difference in feeling to keep things more interesting for myself. All of the varieties are well lubricated (all the way down the condom, unlike other brands) and have different ribbed features. The Intense, is really ribbed, as expected. There are no noticeable feeling differences that I or my female partner have really noticed. The Warming condom is really luby and kind of gross to touch and tastes gross (so I have been told).", 
            "Performance: I have never had a Trojan condom break and I have had several condoms break during proper usage.", 
            "PRICE: This is the main reason that I am leaving this review -- YOU, this exact same pack costs $28 at CVS, no joke! If you are looking for an affordable way to have safer sex with your partner, look no further and take control of your sexual health, this is a great product at a great price!", 
            "Note: There is a review from a female consumer stating that the Warming condom felt uncomfortable. Communicate with your partner -- if there is a problem, stop. Even if you take out the 6 Warming condoms, you are looking at $0.45 a condom vs. $0.77 at other retailers for this product, so it's still a great deal!\n",

The reason why I only gave these condoms 3 stars is that for what ever reason this time around these condoms have a funny smell. A fart smell to be exact. I remember after my boyfriend and I finished we both kind of gave each other the hairy eyeball thinking that the other had farted, then when it happened again and again whenever we used these we finally figured out that it was the condom. ahaha SO if you choose to buy these just be on guard that you may receive a pack that smells a little funky and not to accuse your partner of letting one slip!\n",

The answer: less well. It's a tighter fit than the crown, which might work for someone who finds the Crown is too loose on him. (It was too tight on me.) It's a peculiar color, and in the event that it's used in fellatio, the taste is also unpleasant. Both the Beyond Seven and the Crown models have a reservoir at the tip.",

If you are an under average sized guy I recommend these all the way.\n"

            "\n  Not a bad jimmy hat for your schmekel. Fits good and not too thick for when you want to bust a load in your lady's containment vessel without letting any of your swimmers loose.  Pretty good quality control. No blowouts yet. Should accomodate a variety of schmekel sizes as long as you don`t have a schmekel the size of a Hebrew National salami. If you do, then your on your own .  You can find these at your local Big Lots a lot of times for around $7.00 for a box of 12. Give them a try and have a safe and happy shtoop.\n", 
            "\n  They are solid condoms and feel great and have the bonus protection from pregnancy provided by the spermicide. My only complaint is that the spermicide is that it is sticky and smells a bit funny. Lubrication is paramount because without it the condom can break if caught on dry skin and any artificial lube must be water based.\n",

            "\n  I would not consider these as \"ultra thin.\" They actually feel like regular condoms. I prefer the Trojan Thintensity over these, however, the price is good. There's not much to say; they're not great, but they're not bad.\n", 
            "\n  At this price point, this is a great product, far better than typical lates condoms.  Its probably the next best thing below the .002 import okamoto condoms, but you'll probably be pleasantly surprised compared to any cheaper latex condom,  in fact, I know I'll never buy the cheaper thick latex stuff again.\n", 
            "\n  I bought these because they were ultra thin, and I was looking for more of a \"barely-there\" feeling. While these condoms are super-thin, and did provide increased sensitivity, they contain spermicide (Nonoxynol-9), which some people have adverse reactions to.", 
            "IF you are one of those people, the adverse reactions are excruciating. I was about 30 seconds into intercourse with my girlfriend, and the tip of my penis started to feel irritated. After 10 seconds of it progressively getting worse, I pulled out and removed the condom immediately. After about 5-10 minutes, the irritation subsided and I thought I was OK.", 
            "I woke up 3 hours later to pee. The burning sensation that I experienced was incredibly painful. It happened again when I peed in the morning. Almost unbearable, and only just at the tip. Nowhere else did I feel pain.", 
            "After a bit of online research, it turns out this is a fairly common problem with the Nonoxynol-9 spermicide. It is known to cause incredible pain at the tip of the urethra for some males (and possibly some side effects for women; google it).", 
            "There are some men that have used it for years with no problems. But I wanted to share my experience because I would not wish this pain upon anyone. It was truly awful.", 
            "If you have been using Nonoxynol-9 with no adverse side effects... I'd rate their comfort a 3/5 because they fit OK. They were a little snug, but the tightness was not a problem.", 
            "I'd rate them a 4/5 for reliability because I didn't have one break (but I only used 6 of them before I had my issue; then I threw the rest away). I used the first 5 without any issues.",

            "\n  I recently had to start using condoms because our prior method of birth control was no longer available.  I have tried Trojan Magnums and Magnum Ecstasy (I also tried regular size first but they were too small, so I won't review them).  The Ecstasy ones were just awful.  Worst sex I've ever had in my life.  You can read that review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RIA1GHP046SA9 .  The regular Magnums fit fine and were ok, but still too thick for me to get enough sensation to climax.  I was worried that my sex life was ruined.  Then I tried these because I read good things about them.  LIFE SAVED!  Sex with these on feels MUCH better than with latex.  It feels almost exactly like going bareback. I was able to climax just as easily as with no condom, and my wife said they felt good too.  They are also really strong and stretchable. I opened one up just to see how strong they are and it was pretty hard to tear.  It mostly just stretched to whatever size I stretched it.  I had to put my fingernails into it to get it to finally tear, so I'm confident these things will be reliable and I don't have to worry with them.  I don't see how they could possibly tear from sex.  I highly recommend you try these, even if you're happy with your current brand.  Polyisoprene is the best!  Latex is yesterday's news, IMO.\n", 
            "\n  Almost every other 'large' condom has been painfully tight at the base. Those that weren't, were instead so thick that they were greatly desensitizing. Some terrible few even boasted both flaws. Previously, the one exception was the Trojan Naturalamb, but that smelled like what it was.", 
            "So, my partner and I ultimately gave up on condoms and used a combination of withdrawal and rhythm method to ensure that I pulled out whenever she was fertile. Worked for 10 years at a rate of 4-9 times a month. But lately, her cycle has become less reliable due to job stress, my awareness of ejaculation less consistent, and our willingness to forego the experience of sharing an orgasm less steadfast, so we've opted to return to condoms, in hope that 10 years of nanoscale science have seen some improvements in their design.", 
            "Sure have.", 
            "These things blow away all the other Trojan, Durex, and LifeStyles products I've tried. They're a bit long for me and end up bunching up at the base, but at last a condom both wide enough to be comfortable and thin enough to let me feel most of what I would feel without it. They're a tad desensitizing, of course, but only a bit more than the famously non-desensitizing Naturalamb, and only on the lower half of penis, which doesn't house many pleasure receptors to begin with. The upper 3 to 4 inches feel not only bare, but sometimes better than bare--whether because of the stark contrast with the slightly desensitized base or because of some 'pouching' happening at the head, I don't know, but it's fantastic.\n", 
            "\n  This really is a large condom and not simply labeled \"large\" to make the buyer feel better. These are roughly the same size as a Trojan Magnum.", 
            "If I could give this 50 stars, I would. My girlfriend is severely allergic to latex, and until this came out our only option was those awful female condoms.\n", 
            "\n  I'm going to be real with you, these condoms will fit any guy with a girth above 4.75, so they're not as large as they say, but then again, they can stretch to fit someone with a girth of 6 as well (although very tight) without any breakage. My consensus is that if you're girth is from 4.75-5.75 these condoms will fit very comfortably without loss in sensitivity, if you're under 4.75 they'll be a little baggy and if you're over 6 they'll be pretty darn tight.\n", 
            "\n  I'm one of those guys who is long and thick enough that most condoms are so tight, especially at the base, that I can't climax with a partner. Believe me, I was incredibly frustrated!", 
            "I bought these after doing a search for large-size thin condoms. I hadn't heard about them, but I was going to try anything.", 
            "Well, they're great.", 
            "Now, I have the prolonged sensitivity to the warmth and tight feel of a partner so I can cum again! Also, my partners enjoy it, because they can feel my heat and the involuntary twitches and throbs they find exciting.", 
            "This was truly a life-changing product for me. Get some, you deserve it!\n", 
            "\n  I can't stand the feel of a condom but these are really not all that bad. I didn't need the large size for length just for the extra girth. I've bought these a few times now  but I can't find them anywhere cheaper. So sense I have to use a condom these are my first choice at least  till I find a monogamous partner. I get the majority of the feeling and they actually make me last a little longer so it's a win win for safe sex and prolonged intercourse. ++ for best price buy a few boxes for the Ad on deal well worth it. These cost 12 to15 bucks at the super center and drug stores.\n", 
            "\n  I recently developed a latex allergy and went searching for something that would not irritate me. I found these. They truly are closest to wearing nothing for both him and her. I highly recommend them.\n", 
            "\n  They fit perfectly for me, but make sure you are using a sizing chart to find the right size for you. As far as the condoms themselves, I can't initially tell much of a difference between these and latex condoms such as magnums, but once I get going, it does seem like the condom starts to melt away and it feels much more natural. Definitely prefer these to magnums.\n"
