I would recommend these for people who have latex and other sensitivities.\n",

Took us a few minutes to figure out how to put it on because it's nothing like a latex one. Anyways, didn't feel much different tan latex. My 3 stars are a wishy washy review for the product. Not sure they're worth the money. But I feel they're a little better than latex.\n",

            "\n  I have been using these for the last 15 years and they are by far the best that money can buy.  Thin and extremetly sensitive, I can't imagine going back to any other brand.  The only drawback was the price, however, the price offered for bulk purchases on Amazon was a true bargain!!!\n", 
            "\n  I swear by Crown, Beyond Seven, and Kimono condoms. While restocking, I found a great deal here on Amazon. The picture shows \"Made in Japan,\" as they always were but my batch were made in Thailand. had I known these condoms were of lower grade, I would have gone with Kimono condoms. There is a distinct difference between the Thailand vs Japan versions. I've learned the same of Crown, so buyer beware.\n", 
            "\n  If you're bigger than average, these will help out. I'm super nervous about impregnating someone and having a condom that actually covers me completely is a \"huge\" bonus. They feel pretty good, too. I still suggest adding some water based lube, though. You don't want these to tear, not that any of them have, but again, I'm reaaaally nervous about that.\n", 
            "\n  The condom itself is blue, which is not a problem for us, but I know some prefer the skin colored condoms. They are truly just lightly lubricated, but I prefer that so they aren't so messy when you put them on. Sensation is about what you'd expect, there are definitely thicker ones out there, but there are thinner ones too. We have used about 10 of these so far and all of them have passed the \"water test\" afterwards. Really for the price and quantity it's hard to beat them as they're comfortable and my wife likes them. Crown is the only other that I'd put with this as far as being a good condom for a great price. I wish I would have known about these sooner as it would have saved us a lot of money.\n", 
            "\n  It's the same as the Crown's that I reviewed. They are good condoms with lubricant. I haven't had any problem with it. Just a notice that if you are a big and tall guy, these may not fit you well.\n", 
            "\n  These were thin, sensitive and strong and were not overly lubricated; most condoms we tried had too much lubrication despite the \"lightly lubricated\" claims. Hopefully there will be an unlubricated version for a slightly lower price so the user can try his/her own lubricant.\n", 
            "\n  They sure are extra thin but quite durable. I am surprised because the Trojan condoms that are extra thin almost tear instantly when spicing things up. These here did better than the Trojans. Of course, I am not encouraging to go further off from finding out when it will break, just take it easy. So yes, I recommend these condoms.\n", 
            "\n  A well known, name brand condom, sensitive and durable, at the amazingly low bulk price of about 16 cents each.  Drugstore wants at least $1.50 per in quantity 8 or 12.  What else can I say:  These work fine.  She's happy too.  No unfortunate accidents.\n"

For what ever reason when used another time both my partner and me felt the \"fire\" was too much and was unpleasurable. Id say try them see if you like them if anything just for variety, you may or may not like them. I have mixed feelings on these but probably won't be buying them again.\n",

The warming is mild and builds slowly ... and there is much more sensitivity.  As for the cooling sensation for my girl friend ... all I know is she is very happy during and after sex.\n",

My parter, however, could not handle the sensations so I've used them on a vibrator and it is amazing still.

            "\n  Discovered that I'm either latex sensitive or sensitive to spermicide. Either way, typical latex condemns are not an option. Pregnancy prevention was my primary concern with my partner and first tried the Natural Lamb condoms due to mostly rave reviews on heat transfer, etc. In my experience they were ok, but they did have a slight odor that could be off-putting. The Bareskin non-latex have been a winner for me. They do fit a bit tight and can be a bit daunting to put on. I've went through a few trying to figure out which side is up, but figured out that if I slow down and pay attention to how it comes out of the package it isn't a problem. These have been the best feeling condoms I've worn in terms of heat transfer and how it feels. Of course nothing like no condom, but marked improvement over the latex ones I've tried and I though they felt better than the lamb skin ones.\n",

Trying to put one of these on upside down can result in serious and painfully self injury. Then there is trying to have sex while wearing this straitjacket for your junk. \"Like nothing at all...\" BULL$@@!, it's like going to a all you can eat seafood buffet with a sock on your tongue and a noose around your neck. These fu*king things fit tighter than Chris Christie wearing size 3 spandex after a afternoon at a all you can eat pizza buffet. It's like having a tourniquet slowly tightened around your junk while doing the 'ole in & out. First it hurts, then you go numb..now compound that with the sock comment earlier and you might just give up... First time ever I thought if just giving up, rolling over and going to bed. Meanwhile my wife has this strange look on her face, no it wasn't ecstasy, it was pain. She said it was like trying to have sex with a hot curling iron!!! What do they lube them with, pepper spray? In short, screw these things, well not literally, they're too painful to even put on... We'll take our chances.\n", 
            "\n  Like other reviewers mention these are snug, but I enjoy the them... I would assume I'm average in the size and shape dept.  Wife and no others have ever complained.  The tightness only adds to the enjoyment especially during the blastoff stage for me, but I can see where other folks are coming from if they are perhaps a bit more gifted than I.\n", 
            "\n  With a latex allergy I used these condoms in hope that I could try something new and have a brand to go back and forth to. However, these condoms hurt so bad we had to stop intercourse. It felt like it was burning rubber down there (& yes I was lubricated enought). I do not recommend these condoms to ANYONE with a latex allergy.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms are really difficult to put on. I'm just under 7inches. Took several minutes to put on. The ring(base) of the condom hurts you when fully on. But none the less strong. And odorless. Obviously great for latex sensitive partners.\n", 
            "\n  It prevents pregnancy, and STIs, it deserves one star. Beyond that, heck no. These condoms suck. They have NO stretch, I mean none. My man's dick looked like a sausage trying to fit into a cellophane dress two sizes too small. Talk about sexy (that was sarcasm, in case you didn't hear it). These did smell a tiny bit, now I am thinking about it, and on an averaged sized guy, would likely work out well, if not great. Certainly good for those with latex allergies. I bought two boxes thinking it would be wonderful, and promptly gave both boxes away to single friends of mine, with a comment to only use them on average sized guys. Will not buy again. Ever.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms are super strong, but a little hard to roll on. They kind of sick to themselves at first making them tough to get on quickly.\n", 
            "\n  I agree with the other lousy reviews for this product. I give it two stars because it appears to fulfill the qualities of a standard condom. If you are able to put it on, it may well work a treat. As many other reviews have pointed out, it's a tight fit. Not to toot my own horn, but trying to put one of these on was akin to trying to squeeze into skinny jeans a few sizes too small. I thought \"supra\" might mean \"big enough to accommodate your junk,\" but that's clearly not the case.\n"

            "I have previously reviewed the regular Ultrathin 001. In short, it's a darn good product with terrific sensitivity, a bit better than the Trojan Ultrathin. It also fit a little tighter than other condoms, and, according to the female perspective, \"smells nice\". My positive review said that the condoms were premium products but wondered if it was worth the high price. I also thought that the people who would pay the premium price for the incremental sensitivity would be the playing crowd with frequently changing partners.", 
            "This leads me to the other half of the package. The Nanosilver is, even more so than the regular Ultrathin 001, solidly a product aimed at the customer segment with multiple partners. It is basically the same as the Ultrathin 001 in every aspect, except that it has \"nanosilver\" added. I believe the nanosilver is colloidal silver. Some reviewers commented that it was a spermicide. I don't believe that is the case. The silver is there to kill germs. Look up colloidal silver, and you can see that the purported function of the silver is its ability to disrupt the microbes and stop them from reproducing. I would imagine the risk of catching something is the number one concern for people who frequently change partners or get together with unknown partners. For that reason, I think it is worth price for those particular customers. For other customer segments, they will be well served by the regular Ultrathin 001.",

They come with lube already applied on both sides which is nice.  Honestly, getting used to them was hard, because of a couple of reasons.  First, off, because they are so thin, they are little more difficult to peel downwards.  It helps to use two hands.  Secondly, I kept thinking the condom was broken because it felt so close!  Overall, this is my new favorite condom.  They never broke on me, and I'm pretty girthy.  Trying to pull these off and they just stretch and stretch.",

Even from pulling out exposing it to the air, it showed no signs of weakening or tearing. The ultra thin is a guinness book of world records setter (as all the condoms are.) I thought that was just a gimmick as I've tried several \"ultra thin\" products. No my friends, this is in another league of it's own. The smell is actually quite nice. It is somewhat floral, yet I can't seem to figure out exactly what it is. I've has terrible smells from very high name brand condoms which actually make the experience not as good. When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it's not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don't expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.",

I give it 3/5 only because it's fun to pretend that a mediocre review from some shmuck on Amazon will motivate the company to develop a condom (or alternative way of preventing pregnancy and STDs) that feels even remotely as good as unprotected sex feels.

But they work and are durable, but I wish they were more options.\n", 
            "\n  Great fit, wish comdoms didn't smell so bad though. I did some research and \"measuring\", and the magnums were still too tight. These fit great for me. They are thicker and you don't get as much feeling. I really wish they made the XLs thinner but maybe that is a production problem with the larger size?\n",

Of course they take away feeling, but that may be a lot easier to take than an \"uh oh\" or a \"what do you mean I am gonna die from this?!\"\n", 
            "\n  I have a \"niner\", but my shaft is not as thick as most my size. I also have a \"mushroom\" that I hate to have so compressed and restricted in the typical large condom, so the roomier head design is perfect for me. I also ejaculate with both force and volume, so the extra space and toughness of the latex is reassuring that an accident won't happen. I agree with the other reviewers that the XL should be available in a thin version. That would be perfect. The lack of sensitivity can be challenging. I don't bag as many chicks as I would like, so I find that jerking with these condoms all lubed up is very erotic. I love seeing the little balloon at the end fill up and expand upon climax. Try that, it's fun!\n", 
            "\n  I paid for \"12-count (quantity of 3)\", and I received \"12-count (quantity of 2).\"  The problem is that we really needed to use some immediately after they arrived.  Now the box is open, and I can't return them.", 
            "As for the product: if you need a larger condom, these are better.\n", 
            "\n  What can I say? Everyone will have a different experience with condoms but these serve their purpose and are relatively comfortable. Price is right, and it definitely beats the weird stares standing in the Walmart check out.\n", 
            "\n  These literally couldn't fit on my husband, broke every time within the first 5 minutes. It looked like it was squeezing him and felt uncomfortable for me. Female condoms are the safest for XXL size & twice as sensitive for both of us.\n"

            "The regular ultra thin is awesome. It appears to be very strong and hold up very well through rigorous work. Even from pulling out exposing it to the air, it showed no signs of weakening or tearing. The ultra thin is a guinness book of world records setter (as all the condoms are.) I thought that was just a gimmick as I've tried several \"ultra thin\" products. No my friends, this is in another league of it's own. The smell is actually quite nice. It is somewhat floral, yet I can't seem to figure out exactly what it is. I've has terrible smells from very high name brand condoms which actually make the experience not as good. When I say tight, I mean it. It leaves very little room, but it's not uncomfortable. It actually probably helps with the experience. Now, all this being said, don't expect it to feel like you have nothing on. You still are wearing a condom and it will still feel like a condom. At the same time, compared to ultra thin condoms of other brands, it feels roughly 50% less like a condom.",

These are made for people who may use multiple partners because these condoms are made in a way that the condom helps to clean and sterilize secretions. This is a condom that has an almost sweet smell to them. Nothing like a cootie killin condom that smells like flowers. The condom held up well thru a variety of challenges. Since this is a PG review, no pics or videos were allowed. Overall, we are very pleased with the quality of these condoms. It's been a few years since we had to use a condom so this brought back memories.  My husband said that these condoms helped improve his sex life. He is now wanting to know when the next box is due to come in. We did receive these well made condoms at a reduced cost. We would recommend these because of the quality and the nanosilver infused technology that makes it a clean/safe condom which really can give you that worry free sex. Thanks!!\n", 
            "\n  These are in the Guinness Book of World Records as the thinnest condoms known to mankind and they are indeed incredibly thin. However, it didn't seem to translate into more sensation and that crazy thinness has a couple downsides. Namely, they are really, really tight. In fact, trying to roll it all the way down was next to impossible, meaning it was about halfway on and kept getting in the way. Not comfortable. I do like the idea of bacteria-fighting agents on them, but it's hard to say whether that worked or not (I'm assuming it did). But I don't see enough difference between these and regular condoms to warrant paying the extra money for them.",

The lubricant is applied in an adequate quantity and has less of an odor compared to other brands. The latex is super thin and my husband reports it \"feels like it isn't there, almost alarmingly so\". I admit, we checked a few times to make sure it was still intact - but no problems with breakage. Can't necessarily speak to the \"efficacy\" of the nanosilver \"cleaning\" quality, but definitely no added irritation or anything noted.",

They do however hold up to some rough sex. We have never had one break. We have probably used around 30 condoms. We had a higher breakage rate with Trojan and Durex. The only problem with this particular condom is that it makes me, the female, feel and uncomfortable burning sensation. I thought it would go away but it lasted the entirety of the night. It did not hurt horribly but it was extremely uncomfortable and it made sex unenjoyable. Sadly I cannot recommend this condom. I do however think it is the spermicide. Perhaps I am allergic to this particular kind. I do recommend every other type of Aoni condoms.",

            "\n  these condoms are Durex's answer to the Trojan magnums and they are just as good plus cheaper. I cannot comment on the length comparison of it being the longest on the market but i will say that it is a very long condom. its about a foot long maybe longer, and the diameter is larger too. if the regular durex condoms feel tight for you like they do for me then this is one worth trying. I ordered some to try out along with my usual bulk order of Durex condoms and will probably be ordering a large quantity of these when it comes time to restock my drawer. they are not studded or ribbed which is the only drawback to them, and they are a white/clear latex. the lubricant is the standard nonflavored durex lubricant, and they are not the thickest condom Durex makes but it is more than thick enough to withstand rigorous use. I have broken some of the other brands of condom and have never had a problem with these. Overall a very good purchase and worth trying out if regular condoms are too snug at the base or too short for you.\n",

Works great on subs who you want to play with while letting them know they're not supposed to be enjoying it too much..  again, if you want full on numbing or orgasm delay- buy one of the many desensitizing sprays- there are many.\n",

They are hard to find in stores, so I was pleased to find them on Amazon at such a great price. While these are advertised to slow down a man's orgasm, they feel better than any of the thin condoms I've tried. The texture feels great for both partners, and these don't have a nasty latex smell like so many other brands. My only complaint about these is a small dab of spermicide that looks like a drop of Vaseline. This is easily removed, and should be, since it gets greasy and messy otherwise. These help with five star love making, so they're a five star product by me.\n",

            "\n  I wanted a snugger fitting condom and ordered a set of 12 and after I was with my girl a few night ago I can say that these are worth it. The width of the condom is 1.75in opposed to 2.0in that normal condoms size. With that being said they stay on better and give a much better feel. I highly recommend these and also have heard good things about Beyond Seven condoms as they are the same size (1.75in) if you are in the market for a tighter fitting condom.\n", 
            "\n  Very happy with these.  I'm not thick and these work great.  I shrink a lot when flaccid, and they stay on well after, and doesn't fall of like the regular size does with me.  Good deal for giving them a try.  I'll be buying these from now on.\n", 
            "\n  I'm only about 5 inches so regular condoms are just sloppy and tend to unroll during sex and it just ruins the moment. These fit perfectly and stay on. No more holding the base with one hands while you're pumping!! If you are average size and don't have a problem with regular sized condoms don't get these, they will be too tight but if you're not so privledged and are on the smaller side this will be perfect. Also if you have a small girth but normal length these will work for you too. My girth is normal so they were a little tight at first but this doubled as a cock ring so I don't mind at all. They always come at least a day (up to 3) days earlier than the projected delivery day with discreet packaging. Undercover Condoms is the best.\n", 
            "\n  I am only 5 1/2\" long and 4 1/2\" thick so this condom is perfect for me feels like i dont have anything on at all,regular condoms fit me fine but these things suck to skin for fit that is unreal next time I will buy the bigger box of these.\n", 
            "\n  Condoms are a necessary evil for many in life. And yes, dicks come in all shapes and sizes. Most people don't like that some condoms feel too tight for them. And so many guys think its an ego boost to pull out a magnum that clearly isn't made for what they have in their pants. Personally I love the \"snugger fit\" of these guys. My penis is completely average at a little over 6\" long and 4.5-5\" thick, and I have no shame in that (I've seen many smaller, believe me!). These fit me PERFECTLY. Comfortable, easy to put on, and no risk of any type of slippage. Despite the product picture, the packaging does not say \"snugger fit\". They are just in a purple wrapper with the generic Lifestyles markings on them. So there is no need for any anticipated awkwardness that may come from someone seeing you're using a \"snugger\" condom.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms are a work of art, I am about seven inches and I could not find me a condom that wouldn't fall off. But these they stay on, and they are very snugged fit. I will be buying more thanks so much.\n",

            "\n  Good buy they are cheaper and are discret when shipped. Got the. Actually a couple days earlier and it feels just like any other condom I recommend this to anyone who isn't a giant down there in width. Good brand\n"

            "A++ for these condoms. I bought them at Walgreens for $16 bucks, mostly because I wanted to try them right away but next time I will buy from amazon for the better deal, especially when I can get free shipping.\n", 
            "\n  Not something I'd normally review.  Since I rely heavily on reviews for my purchases including this recent purchase I figured what the heck.", 
            "Everything all the people say about these condoms is true.  Also because they are made basically from high grade plastic there is no worry about what lubricant you use.  They fit well and are less snug than normal condom.", 
            "Oh one other thing.  Mine came in a zip lock bag so don't expect one of those cool boxes you usually get at the store, but who cares as long as the product is intact that is what maters.  That zip lock bag comes in a usual Amazon box that you can probably have your three year old drive over in his tricycle and still have no damage.  (However don't try this at home.)\n", 
            "\n  Girl review here: So, I'm allergic to latex. I took it upon myself to get an IUD to not get pregnant until I wanted to get pregnant because of this with my ex boyfriend three years ago. Well, needless to say, we broke up a year after that. Meet this wonderful guy and he's everything I would want in a guy, besides a few things...but hey, I'm a girl, of course I am going to nit pick.", 
            "His only issue with us having sex...which of course we have all the time...is that he has herpes and I do not. I am not taking the risk either even though he has not had an outbreak in over five years. Sorry, medical professional here and I know the stats, which are in my favor, but nope, that is not going to happen.", 
            "Feels weird to be having 'protected' sex again, but like the other reviewer said, this product is awesome. It feels almost like its not there and it doesn't have the funky smell like some other brands.", 
            "Only brought it online because my store stopped carrying this brand since I guess I am the only one buying them.\n", 
            "\n  Staying safe is needed. This the only condom I use now. The non-latex is a winner for me, it keeps me in the game. Great feel,  no slip off. Plus now a days females has to stay away from latex do to allergic reaction of latex condom.\n", 
            "\n  There is a slightly tighter fit compared to the Trojan Magnum Bare Skin condoms.  It is great not having the latex smell but I prefer the Trojans since they feel thinner giving him and her more pleasure.\n", 
            "\n  Very comfortable, way better feel than Magnums or Magnum XL.  Maybe a bit larger than Magnums and smaller than Magnum XL.  Not as long as Durex XXL.  And no latex!\n", 
            "\n  They are a bit smaller than Trojan Magnums (large), but they also feel thinner. I've found that they can get too tight if I don't leave a bunch of extra room at the tip.\n", 
            "\n  I keep buying from you guys because the price is great for a 24 count. I will definitely be a return customer! Great product if you are allergic to Latex!\n"

            "\n  One caveat right out of the gate, One, in general, has a bit of a snug fit compared to other companies. They do this because to help make them more effective and no point is a regular too tight. Other than that these are great, my fianc\u00e9 loves them and I like them since they are also a tad thinner so it feels more natural. All One styles are thinner and feel better than brands like Trojan. I always buy them on here as they are far cheaper on Amazon than in stores around me. And a second note all the condoms in this bulk pack when I got it were at least a year and a half until their expiration, so you have more than ample time to get your use of them.\n"
