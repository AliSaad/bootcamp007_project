            "\n  If you care about the environment, remember that a condom makes an excellent water balloon or birthday party decoration. Why does this matter? Because of the law of environmental replacements. A used condom used in place of an eco-unfriendly balloon is a balloon that never existed... so how green is that? At a wedding, the wedding coordinator can fill all the happy couple's saved used condoms with helium, then release them as the bride exits the church, making for a very meaningful and moving fertility ceremony. If the groom gets a little help from his friends in filling out the used condom bouquet, there may be enough condomiums to lift the flower girl into the air, which is a blessing on the marriage and a sure promise of fecundity. Plus, all the trash that flower girl would have created during her life is probably not going to be a problem now. When she gets to OZ, the recycling program there is so green that they call it the Emerald City.",

            "\n  I (we) stayed from Trojan Ultra-Thins for experimentation and ventured into the latex-free assuming they would be thinner... WRONG (I pity those with latex-allergies! Sucks to be you). Back to latex and we tried some Durex Extra-Sensitives, they fit SO bad. They kept bunching up at the top and creating friction so uncomfortable I kept having to stop. I was about to go back to our trusty Trojans when I decided to try these since the price was so enticing. I LOVE THEM. They fit so well! No bunching. No slipping off at the base. No breaking. Nothing bad at all and super thin to boot!", 
            "They are all pink which is funny.", 
            "To those complaining about getting a bag full of condoms in the mail instead of excess packaging (depending on the vendor): Shame on you! They're already individually wrapped! I personally hate unnecessary packaging, not only from a \"green\" standpoint but a convenience one as well.", 
            "p.s. I'm sorry I used the word \"green\" I personally hate the slogan but it fit.\n", 
            "\n  These are really then and very close to having nothing on at all. They are minimally lubed so they don't feel greasy or sticky, and they don't carry that horrible latex smell that many other brands do. Never had an issue of breakage so far. Recommended.\n", 
            "\n  I was really hoping that the hype about these was true, and it is. These are very thin and very strong. The thinness actual lets you feel tiny movements while wearing one. I did some crazy stretching tests, and couldn't get one to break. I've had horrible problems with Trojan condoms, but these feel great and I actually trust them. They are fairly tight, but that contributes to the sensation. They are a little more difficult to put on than average, but it's worth the extra effort. They fit well for me (above average length/girth). They are as wide as most condoms, but only seven inches long. These things are an incredible value.\n", 
            "\n  I often have an issue with condoms where it becomes difficult for me to finish due to a distinct decrease in sensation , but these condoms are remarkably thin and feel almost as if you aren't wearing one at all. Also, thankfully, as thin as they may be, they still feel durable, which of course is a very important quality for a condom to have.\n", 
            "\n  After researching laboriously online I discovered that Okamoto no longer makes these condoms in Japan but in Thailand. Other users have said how this affects how thin and reliable the condoms actually are but I have not had any from the Japan batch so I wouldn't know. My shipment was from thailand. But overall these condoms are very thin and give a VERY close fit. Im average size and girth and they work great for me. If you are larger though I would suggest getting a looser fit since these might be stretched quite a bit and not feel as good. So just be warned that these are made in Thailand and I HAVE heard of some breaking, but so far I have not had any break on me (a little bit over 10 used at this point.)\n", 
            "\n  This is an amazing brand, the thinnest condoms I've ever used; literally almost like nothing is there. They're like a pinkish color. People say that since the company has started making their condoms in Thailand that they've fallen in quality. This is not true, after extensive research I've learned that the quality is exactly the same, exact same production methods, although the dimensions for the condom have changed slightly; it's much more tighter now. Was delivered on time, great price, great quality, doesn't get much better than this!\n", 
            "\n  I have to admit I was skeptical that these condoms would give the \"as close to wearing nothing at all\" feeling, but they do.  My partner can't tell when I wear one, which is unusual with other condoms.  Like other reviews indicate, they do fit very snug, and are a little on the small side, but for the \"natural\" feeling they give, I find the negatives are not bad.\n", 
            "\n  Ok, I know this can be a touchy issue but I dont know how else to say it except to say that if you want to feel the real thing, use these condoms because Im telling you now you can feel the warmth and everything! Their claim of \"Its like wearing nothing at all\" is 100% true!\n"

            "\n  Maybe it's just not for me. Definitely added to the stimulation, but it's a bit cumbersome and seems to get in the way. If I wanted to be lazy and just lay there, I see how it could be beneficial. Unfortunately, with the moving and gyrating, it was just a bit of an inconvenience. Glad I tried it though!\n", 
            "\n  Weak depth vibrations. Doesn't cross over into female zones unless it's sitting idle not moving. Instructions say it's a 1 time use and toss in the trash can. Yet the battery's are replaceable if you want more use. Ring and vibrations dont do much for man. This is a starter \"training wheels\" for couples wanting to play with sex toys.\n", 
            "\n  I didn't know what to expect with this one. I mean, it does what it's supposed to: vibrant. I wish there were size choices. This was way too small for my husband. I had to force it on him for a few seconds just to try it out. I wish the entire ring vibrates instead of the super tiny clip(?). I think the price matches the value. Next time, we will make an investment instead of wasting money on a cheap experiment.\n", 
            "\n  I wouldn't purchase this product again as the package was open when it arrived. The outer Amazon back was sealed but the manufacturer box was open and the tape or seal was pulled off. Gave it one star because at least it did arrive.\n", 
            "\n  The part of this that actually vibrates is not shaped correctly to get where it needs to go, that being said, the vibrations are strong enough that it is great if/when it gets there.", 
            "The batteries can not be changed and only last around 20 minutes so it usually doesn't even last for one \"session\".", 
            "Overall it is a fun and cheap way to add something a little extra once in awhile but for the more regular user there are many other, and better, options out there.\n", 
            "\n  She loves whenever I use these so when she's happy. Everyone is happy. Good product. I like that they are disposable.  No need to clean them up every time . Just toss them and use a new one next time\n", 
            "\n  A great starter product for couples looking to try new things. My spouse and I have not used a vibration ring before and wanted to try a cheaper, more disposable option before investing in a more expensive option. The ring worked well the entire time we had intercourse, and still vibrates, so in theory you could use the ring again as long as the battery lasts. We did not use the condom the comes with the pack so I do not have any feedback for that particular product. Overall, this is a product that we would purchase again. Product was delivered in a very discreet package that came from \"Amazon Fulfillment Services.\"\n"

            "\n  I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction.  As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way.  I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life.  These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation.  I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.", 
            "One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there):  If you're ... y'know ... \"oversized,\" you might find these too tight.  My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.\n", 
            "\n  I like these condoms as compared to most non-latex. I've tried another kind (forget the brand) that were painful they were so hard and crinkley. I've also tried Trojan Supra but those are for smaller guys I guess. But these are the only non-latex brand I think I will buy now. A bit pricey though.\n"

            "\n  I order these condoms on 6/9/11 got them on  6/20/11 i open the bag that it came in and the box's were crushed and the box's were full of dust, and i have one month to use 48 condoms cause they expire on  7/2011  do not buy old,dirty condoms\n", 
            "\n  My fave condom. Fits the well endowed guy, but is also snug enough on the average fella. The lubricant is very light & non-irritating (if you're sensitive to lube, like me) & the latex isn't so thin that you're afraid it will break. I've tried many different brands & Durex is definitely my favorite.\n", 
            "\n  What else can I say? Two out of the same box broke, which is very scary. I'm in a committed relationship so STD/HIV isn't an issue but if it were I'd be scared.\n", 
            "\n  Maybe its a generational thing, but I still can't screw up the courage to announce my business to the checker at the drugstore. Much as I enjoy using this product, I enjoy even more the ability to buy online.\n", 
            "\n  The condoms arrived as advertised, in separate boxes and a reasonable amount of time until expiration. However what your getting is nothing special, just a plain basic condom that's thinner than most competitors. Your (female) partner won't get any included benefits though they do feel pretty good on the male side because you don't feel like your making love in a rubber sock like some other thicker condoms. If your simply looking for a condom that does the job and doesn't get in the way of your fun these are the way to go. I prefer to make the night memorable without the help of a tricked out condom anyways.", 
            "P.S. These are amazingly strong too so there is no need to worry about them breaking, it's nice to know that you can put them on and forget about them!\n", 
            "\n  I got this and the Trojan Bareskin in the same purchase and tried them back to back, the Trojan Bareskin just feels better.\n", 
            "\n  My husband and I have been married 2+ years and we love these ones. These are the only ones we use. Been using them for nearly 2 years and always use these ones. I have sensitive skin and my husband has problems with his foreskin. And these ones don't cause us any discomfort.", 
            "The way this came packages was in a shipping box and the two boxes of condoms where in a bag together. I like getting two small packages. One for the nightstand and one goes into or box of toys. We do this because it is easier to hide a box of 12 instead of a box of 24.", 
            "Overall we enjoy these ones the most out of the condoms we have tried including the trojan brands.\n", 
            "\n  I received this product for free from Durex. I usually use another brand of condoms and I had never tried these until Durex gave me a free sample, and I'm hooked. They really do let you feel more. Me and my partner love them. The condoms I used before trying these were also \"sensitive,\" but were not as good as these by far. I recommend these. #durexsexplorers\n"

It felt like putting on a bread bag, just too big and that made them lose a lot of sensitivity.  They worked, but it created a lot of worry about slippage and offage and that whole ball of wax.  Never had this issue with a zillion other Trojans or Lifestyles I've used.",

I'm not the cockness monster but these definitely would not work as well for average/smaller size guys. They feel great, the lube actually lasts as long as it needs to, and overall I think they are my favorite condom for comparing feel/lubrication quality. I've found a couple of the condoms in each box tends to have a strange/off putting odor, but generally speaking they are fine smell wise. Despite the occasional rankness I gave them a deserving 5, but I have never had one break and they work phenomenally!\n", 
            "\n  These are hands down the worst condoms I've ever had the misfortune of using.  Opening the box, they look like they are designed for horse; Ron Jeremy couldn't use these condoms effectively.  That \"room for movement\" actually means that it looks and feels like you're putting a sandwich bag on your penis and fastening it with a rubber band (my fiance reports that's what it feels like to her too).  Texturally, the ribs are reminiscent of the molted skin from the movie Alien.  You get almost no feeling of sliding, just pressure.  I think you'd get more sensation using a latex glove.  In short, only use this condom if your choice is it or no sex, otherwise get anything else!\n", 
            "\n  I bought a 10 pack of these and only used three. They're as wide as any extra-wide condom you'll buy, which is NOT advertized anywhere, which is extremely annoying. As others have said, I'm not the cockness monster, but I certainly am not small, and these were too loose. Another one in the box was tighter than the other two I used, and while it fit correctly...I could definitely tell I was wearing a condom. The three times we've used these have been our three most disappointing times we've had intercourse, my first time even being much better.", 
            "The only other brands I've used were generic style Trojans, which were alright, and Beyond Seven \"Sheerlon\", which were amazing. If you're looking for a reliable condom that feels like nothing is there, go with Beyond Seven. They don't ACTUALLY feel like nothing is there, (no condom will) but after a few minutes of lovemaking with them on it will feel like they're not there. Almost every time I've used them I've stopped at least once to make sure it hadn't fallen off.\n",

These were pretty thick compared to the rest, smelled heavily of latex, and the lubricant was less than stellar. Any skin these touch will smell, and I'd imagine taste pretty bad.",

It was cheaper and stress free to go this route.  The condoms were no different from what you'd find at the drug store.  I will be purchasing again.\n"

            "\n  Wondrous joy! Thinnest condom on the market (though I've heard of the elusive 0.01mm, but cannot find it)! Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)", 
            "Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...", 
            "If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2\" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir. I've read that these condoms are ~1.4\" girth, but up to 2\", you'll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don't work out for you.\n", 
            "\n  I have been using Sagam's for several years now. They are great, the feel is nice. Plus they are thin. I have to say that I got these faster then I thought I was going to get them. Highly recommend them.\n", 
            "\n  I always used bulk condoms, but I tried to buy this item for me. My choice was excellent. The feeling is really good because before I use this item, my condoms were not good. Anyway If you want to use strong and skinless condoms, I recommend you to use it. Try it.\n", 
            "\n  Other ultra thins are horrible compared to this one.  It fits snug and very thin so I feel everything. I'm good size guy so I was concerned by other comments and realized that they probably didn't even try it. Worth the extra cost.\n"

After struggling with protection being a smooth transition, I finally decided to purchase this product some months ago and give it a whirl. It has made wonderful difference, and has increased the ease of the transition of applying protection dramatically. It lives up to the marketing, and I'm very pleased to find a source that is very reasonably priced. I didn't think anyone could beat Target's price, and it counts towards Amazon Mom purchases (which I just find amusing because of the irony.) Girlfriend gives a big thumbs up!\n",

This translates to more feel, but they certainly aren't as thin as regular thin condoms.

Kimono's get the job done and have the most sensation of all of ultrathins I've tried. (Durex, Lifestyles, Trojan)  Bigger gentleman (<~6.5 inches) be warned:  This product is not built for you. Check out the Kimono's large version which fits and protects better.  Also be more careful when handling and using these, if you and your lover are crazy rough in the bedroom you'll want to look out or consider using Durex extra sensitive which is almost as good and sturdier.  Also if you don't put it on right on a frequent basis you'll also want to look elsewhere as they can fail easy if not used correctly.

These latex, Japanese-made condoms are the best on the market, I believe. Despite the other brand of condoms you can get in bulk and for dollars, this is still a value even if you were to shop retail for condoms (at the drugstore).", 
            "I am a big fan of Kimono condoms; they have never broken on me, are the thinnest in the market, and give me a real sense of security and safety when using them. Though some might buy condoms with the only goal in mind: to save money and get in bulk, they often overlook quality and the track record of the condom. Not only are these condoms highly rated and manufactured to the strictest of guidelines and tests, but knowing the Japanese and their infusion of tradition into their manufacturing, honor in craftsmanship is a real asset for manufacturing condoms. And so not one has broken on me, nor failed to meet expectations-a common area most other condom companies don't bother to look closely into.", 
            "For the price vs quantity, this is a real deal! The picture of the product looks nothing like the ones shipped to me and with normal reasoning; the picture is simply outdated. Same product advertised, but the manufacturer ships them in this elegant and classy box approx the same size. Amazon shipped it to me, and it came in a box and SEALED! Very nice, and I can't stress how important that is! You never ever want to have the fate of an unexpected pregnancy rest on the carelessness of a seller that ships damaged condoms to your doorstep. Even micro tearing which can result to prolonged exposed to the elements, friction, etc.",

As for feel, they are typical condoms and not remarkable in either a positive or negative way. Decent texture (smooth - no ribs or dots or studs. But a nice smooooth texture. Give them a try if you like snug.",

            "\n  Man, these things are tight...  They will certainly not slip off during the most demanding merciless pounding you can provide with your pile-driver. Keep 'em well lubricated and hammer away.  They should work well for your back-door excursions!\n", 
            "\n  I'm sure it's a great product but I couldn't get these on. The name says it all. I thought they would be tighter as to feel like nothing is there but make sure you need these before you buy.  Don't sell yourself short like I did.\n", 
            "\n  I'm on the smaller side (1 \" wide and 3-1/4\" long) and regular condoms fall right off. My wife found a trick over the years, unrolling them totally over my penis and testicles, and then they stay on, but are loose and baggy around my penile shaft. These are better, but still a little \"roomy\". We'd prefer two sizes narrower if they were available.\n"

The column flares up to a respectable 118 mm (4.66\") just above the base, which would be much more interesting. Alas, due to the way the pedestal is scuplted, it is not possible to invert the toy and proceed. What is left for use then is the top half of the column, up to around 250-255 mm (10\"). Past the crest at the top, said column is very smooth, with not a mark on it apart from the tiny bump, which is unremarkable, but serves as a marker, indicating where to stop.

            "\n  Come to find out, I've been using too small of a condom (these). I've been through 2 boxes of these and they never ripped. I recently ran across some info that led me to believe my Magnums may be too small and that I should try Magnum XL. XL's don't choke as bad as these did. But, that isn't to the fault of these condoms. I applaud them - cause they never ripped during use.\n", 
            "\n  Yo, me and my baby doll used this but now she got pregnant and had a baby.  It don't look like me at all..she said I'm the only one.  I don't know...maybe there was a hole in it or something.  I'd say pull out early rather than wrap your dog in a piece of plastic.\n",

            "\n  I used to buy these in store before switching to ordering online. For some reason I feel iffy about ordering condoms online but I finally decided to do so after seeing the drastic difference in price. I am very happy with the performance and comfort of these condoms and have used them for years. I will continue to order these off Amazon as long as the online price continues to dominate the in store price.\n",

            "While they are lubricated, I found I occassionally needed a little more lube, but this may depend on you and your partner.\n", 
            "\n  Birth Control pills made me moody and crazy as hell so my boyfriend & I have been using these for over a year instead and so far, no pregnancy or any other problems! They're not too tight for him either like the first ones we tried (Durex, first and only one of those came off inside too!). Also much cheaper to buy these in a 12 pack than 3 packs at the store. Recommended!\n", 
            "\n  I'm not huge by any standard, but the regular size condoms are just to tight. These fit perfect and do the job. Very happy with my purchase. Would recommend this product and seller.\n"

            "\n  Great condom. Thin with great sensitivity, less nasty smell (not completely absent IMO), just the right amount of lube. And they're cheap!! Only problem I have is they're a little tight and do tend to slip off a little. I've never had one come completely off though. Would definitely buy again.\n", 
            "\n  We've tried many, many different thin (some dangerously so!) condoms and I have to say that this was by far the BEST condom.  Very thin - almost feels like nothing is there - but also very reliable.  No slips, leaks or other surprises.  Package says made in Thailand.  Can't imagine a better feel than these!\n", 
            "\n  The 12 Pack Of Crown Condoms arrived very quickly, and in very good condition. The actual condoms are in a BLUE container, not a silver container. This is ok since it is the condom, not the packaging of the condom, that really matters. My girlfriends and I are pleased...\n", 
            "\n  These are by far the best condoms I have ever used (previous brands/products trojan, lifestyle, durex, magnum, and iron grip. After things get a little warmed up these condoms feel unbelievably natural. It took me a few  times to get comfortable with them because you begin to feel like they are coming off because things feel so natural but these condoms aren't going anywhere until you rip them off. We ALL know that feeling where we are into it but we know the condom is one and then things feel a little TOO good and we pull out and look down to see if the condom came off. Not the case with these. If you put them on correctly and unroll them all the way down, they stay on and suck and stick to your skin. I pulled out on more than one occasion and saw that the condom was still on, tried to pull it off because I thought it leaked or broke and the condom was like a suction cup and was not coming off, period. Didn't do much for the mood but it gave me confidence that these puppies are not coming off in the heat of the a moment. We all know the infamous position that makes most condoms traditionally slide off. This one stayed on no matter how hard, fast, deep or slow the action got. Again, the key is to put it on CORRECTLY. If you do that it's not going anywhere. I'm buying a larger pack and will stick with this brand going forward.\n", 
            "\n  This condom is very high quality. The packages that I received were made in japan. Best one that I have tried. It was very difficult to break with my hands even though they are soo thin.",

            "\n  My husband likes this product better than any other condom that you can find at walmart (trojan, etc.) He says he can feel more with this condom then the others and have never had a problem with breaking!\n", 
            "\n  Based on reviews about Crown Condoms, I purchased some for me and my boyfriend. He said they don't feel different and I sure can't feel the difference. These aren't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order them.\n"

            "\n  Got this during the labor day sale and I must say this is the best discreet bang for buck toy out there. The instructions and functionality are extremely ambiguous on which of the 3 buttons to press/hold or tap (still trying to make sense of it all), but what is obvious is there are many more patterns than suggested in the manual. I've also noticed there seem to be one or two of the patterns where the harmonics of the motor can change ever so slightly be it to glans positioning or otherwise to give you a truly \"random\" experience.\n", 
            "\n  Takes a very long time to build up if you're using it hands free, just leaving it in place. If you take a more manual approach massaging it around it's still takes some time but significantly less. Seems to take forever to charge but it lasts more than enough time to do its job. Almost too intense for me and leaves my head numb, but strong and satisfactory.\n", 
            "\n  This is a major departure in male self pleasure. Just about every device out there tries to replicate the sensations of sex or hand stroking. This takes a very different approach, delivering gradual sensory overload to a guy's most sensitive nerve endings. I had my doubts that this would work for me but as it is a different technological approach, a different mind-set is what makes it work. This isn't a device for a quickie. Plan some time to relax, sit back, get that favorite fantasy going in your mind and then go through the settings. The buttons are easy to use and very responsive. Some thick water based lube increases vibration transfer. Just click it on and then click through the vibration patterns until things happen. The first time, it was sneaky. I felt good  but not great and then I hit one setting which pushed all of my buttons at once and about a minute later without any thrusting or stroking of any kind, I exploded. As I felt myself passing the point of no return I even thought, \"This can't be happening!\"\n",

            "\n  Failed after three days. Used twice. Not sure why it failed, but since it's a sealed unit I can only guess that it could not handle its own vibrations.\n", 
            "\n  I've had this for over a year now, and it is my go-to toy for convenience and sensation. I happen to enjoy vibrations (especially strong ones like from the Hitachi Magic Wand) and this generally delivers in the right place (the glans). Although they are nowhere near as strong as the Hitachi, focusing on the right spot really works for me. It does take some getting used to, and I needed to experiment with positioning, but once I got it, it can get me off nicely. It is reasonably quiet and discrete\n"

I have medical issues that make it impossible for me to take birth control, if we would have found these sooner we would have been able to avoid having three baby girls within four years. Thank GOD we have finally found something that works, I need a break!\n",

            "I ordered the stud stopper, and chose the large because it listed a poundage that my male dog falls into (26-85lbs.).  When it arrived it smelled so strongly of chemicals that I had to let it air out for a couple of days as I was afraid to put it on my dog.  When I did put it on my dog I was kinda surprised at how simple the item actually is, it is essentially a velcro belt molded to a large piece of leather which acts like a shield between the studs member and any potential female.  This would have worked, except that the stud stopper kept falling back so low on my male dog's hips that it was on the wrong side of his genitals, and therefore wasn't going to stop anything.  I adjusted and tightened the strap a couple of times, but I couldn't get it tight enough fitting without becoming overly constricting to my dog's abdomen to keep it in place.", 
            "I emailed the seller informing her of the problem, and was disappointing when she responded defensively, and claimed that I never submitted measurements per the email from her company.  I responded back informing her that no such ordering information requests existed on the Stud Stopper Amazon listing, just a general prefab size and weight range. She then spent several emails backpedaling and generally giving the impression that she didn't know what her listing even said, and indicated she would change the listing and that I could send the product back with measurements and she'd try to fix it.  I responded that I would be interested in that, but then never heard from her again when I inquired what measurements specifically she needed to make the adjustments.",

            "\n  We got this for our Golden Retriever stud...  He wears it ok, it doesn't seem to bother him, but sometimes I've noticed it works it's way a little too far back to be effective, if you know what I mean.  I certainly love the concept, as there are times when we don't want to breed, but I don't think I will completely trust this device.  Our girls will have to continue visiting with their Aunty Barbie for a couple of weeks.  It might work fine for other types of dogs.  We got the gold color, it is really a bright gold, so maybe tan would have been better...\n", 
            "\n  Took measurement around his waste for a perfect fit.  Item stays on and the dog is able to jump, run and play as well as pee while wearing this device. Works for us as a reliable barrier in preventing him having undesirable physical contact with female dogs.\n", 
            "\n  I found this very innovative product when I was in a panic having had my 1.5 yr old German Shepherd go into heat after getting a Maremma Sheepdog that was 6 months old. The logistics of keeping these friends separate would have been daunting. We put the Stud Stopper on him and were able to allow them to be in the same enclosure. What a fabulous idea this is! The quality of the product is obvious. We got many questions when people saw him wearing his \"apron.\" The proof in the product is that we do not have an unexpected litter while determining whether she will be part of a breeding program. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a need to avoid an unplanned pregnancy. The inventors are fabulous and were always able to answer questions with knowledge and humor.\n", 
            "\n  Very cheap and a rip off...it's like $2.50 worth of vinyl and a piece of black elastic and cost $50.00...the dog pulls it off within 5 minutes of putting it on him.  Worthless waste of money.\n", 
            "\n  I really did not think that a \"flap\" would work to keep two dogs determined to reproduce unsuccessful. Much to my surprise they did not work together to rip it off of the male. I did have to add a detail to keep it from coming off of him but it was very simple and proved to be an amazingly efficient and effective form of birth control. The two dogs in question are American Staffordshire Terriers. For those who are familiar with the breed will understand that this is quite a feat. Being a powerful and acrobatic pair I was much amazed and happy at the outcome with this heat cycle. Of course you do not just put it on and leave it until the heat is over. One must be a responsible and attentive  pet owner; as well as a responsible and demanding parent when necessary.\n", 
            "\n  We were unwise to think that we would be successful at keeping our breeding dogs apart during an undesired heat. We tried diapers, crating, but nothing was a viable solution until the stud stopper. The dogs got to simulate mating, exhaust their instincts, and ultimately we have no puppies which is the desired result! The male dog was able to urinate and fulfill his biological needs, without mating our female dog.\n", 
            "\n  This product was perfect!  When visiting friends and family, we always take Scooter everywhere we go.  This allows us to visit without worrying about keeping them apart.  With the Stud Stopper we are able to enjoy time together vice letting our pets aggravate and dominate our attention.  Such a great investment!\n"

            "\n  If you're looking for a place for a few condoms, this will work well.  You can put several in there and the case is more suited to being kept in a glove compartment, overnight bag, or gym bag rather than a pocket. The latch is strong but for me it is a little bigger than I want in a front pocket.\n", 
            "\n  So, I felt the need to mention to those who are not aware that friction and heat destroy the structural integrity of condoms. Both will wear down the thin rubber and make it far more likely the condom will break, therefore the last place you want to keep a condom is in your pocket or a glove compartment. This item would be appropriate for a purse if you wish to prevent puncture of the condom, but given that pocket use is still advised in the ad it still only merits one star. If you are looking for a safe way to carry condoms in your wallet, even this wallet, I would advise Trojan's hard cased 2Go condoms. Or try looking for another hard case to store the condoms, old memory card holders, gameboy game cases, mint tins, any small container that will prevent compression. I have not bought this item and have no intention of doing so, but thought this may be helpful for those interested in the future.\n",

            "\n  I bought these in hopes of finding something that did no irritate me, and totally lucked out. These are BY FAR the best condoms I have ever used. They do not have a rubber smell, they're thin, and extremely durable. Best of all, unlike latex condoms, they do not dry me out! I read where a few others have complained about them fitting a bit snug, but my man had no issue with them. Try them out, I'm willing to bet you'll love them.\n", 
            "\n  the studs created a very interesting sensation, so no complaints there. However, the smell is a little funky, and i dont know what i think about it. overall its a thin condom and my girlfriend enjoyed the studs very much\n", 
            "\n  These are the best condoms on the market for my money. She loves the studs, we both prefer a lack of lubrication, they are very very thin, not like nothing, not really even close, but nothing ever will be. The purple color is pretty cool though, not that that matters. The best, absolute best thing about these condoms is the price though. Getting 100 for the price of 12 at the brick and mortar stores. Amazing deal, on a really fantastic product.\n", 
            "\n  My girlfriend enjoys the small bumps on here, and it is a nice to have some of these around in order to break up the monotony of typical condoms. The bumps aren't overly intense, and are really only felt in a significant way by her. But, hey, making her happy is the name of the game right?\n", 
            "\n  Can't complain about the price, but the ring feels too constricting for me enough that I do not enjoy myself. Look for a larger size if you may experience this problem.\n", 
            "\n  Overall these are awesome.  They are pretty thin, the studs add some thickness, but very little.  The texture is great, the wife is happy, and so am I.  Haven't had any problem with these breaking, although they are snug.  I recommend these.\n", 
            "\n  These are my favorite condoms. They are very thin allowing for maximum sensitivity and just slightly smaller than regular at 50mm width(regular is 52mm). That minor difference makes ALL the difference. Sometimes regular condoms would slip off, but these never do. This is all I use now. The price was fantastic and they were shipped very quick.\n", 
            "\n  This is a good product for the price and the amount of condoms that you get.  Now as for the studding part of the condom, I couldnt feel it to the touch and my partner couldnt feel it as well.  So you might as well just get the regular condom.\n"

            "\n  Works great.  I like the fact that its SIMPLE.  No unnecessary spikes or bumps.  It has a few veins as a real penis would but not overly done.  Easy to clean and keep in storage until next use.  Obviously its much, much thicker than a condom so you (men) wont \"FEEL\" everything as you would with a normal Trojan condom.  But on the plus side of its thickness is you will go much, much longer until you are......Finished.  My wife and I occasionally use it,  but I use it more for her than for me because of the fact that it takes a little bit away from me,  but adds so much more lasting time for her.  She is \"Happy\" that we can have long lasting multiple positions before I'm \"DONE\"  And yes,  I do \"cum\" to a conclusion,  but more extended in time.  So if anything,  get it for her.  She will love the lengthy stamina you can give her.\n"

            "\n  My wife and I love these. Which she's allergic to latex so it's great to have some non-latex because even though we're married still not ready for a kid. Lol. 5 Stars.\n", 
            "\n  My girlfriend and I have tried many different types and brands of condoms. To us these win hands down. With traditional latex condoms you have the horrible odor, reduced feeling, and lack of warmth transmitted. These both of us had much more feeling as well as no odor. They do feel and look sort of fragile but as we can attest they are quite durable. The only downside with these, at least for me is they are a little tough to put on. They are quite snug and I am an average size. If you have a larger size these are definitely not the ones for you.", 
            "We will continue to use these! Plus it was such a deal here on Amazon. At the store it would cost a little more money for two boxes than it did here for three.\n", 
            "\n  I have used all sorts of non-latex condoms and these are the best.  I used to enjoy Durex Avanti condoms and enjoyed them even though they were like wearing a sandwich bag, but they were discontinued and replaced by Durex Avanti Bare and are unacceptable.  Bare and Skyn both get really tacky really easily and I have shred vaginas with them due to the tackiness gripping the labia and ripping it.  No joke, this happened on multiple occasions.", 
            "Anyway, the Supras fit well and feel pretty alright, if grading on a curve.  I mean, condoms are like wearing snowpants and non-latex condoms are even worse, but these aren't horrible and are far better than STIs or pregnancies.  They don't get nearly as tacky as the previously mentioned condoms, but I still suggest checking them occasionally to be sure and have lube on hand.\n", 
            "\n  I'm 18 and originally purchased these condoms because my girlfriend and I realized that she had a slight latex allergy. However, I now buy them because of how much better they feel than latex. I originally used Crown condoms by Okamoto, but the Trojan Supras completely blow them out of the water!", 
            "My girlfriend recently went on the pill, but we still use condoms once in a while when we don't have time to get messy. These condoms, by far, provide the most realistic sensation of any condoms I've tried. The body heat transfer through polyurethane is superb, and it really is the next best thing to nothing at all.", 
            "I'm on the larger side of the penis spectrum, but these condoms still fit perfectly. I've used them countless times and have yet to have a bad experience. These are definitely a must buy for anyone looking to experiment with non-latex condoms or looking for condoms that bring them closer to the real thing.", 
            "PROS:", 
            "-Amazing body heat transfer", 
            "-Works for girls with allergies", 
            "-Perfect fit that isn't too suffocating around the base", 
            "CONS:", 
            "-On the expensive side. But definitely worth every penny. Once you go polyurethane, you'll never go back.\n", 
            "\n  I am allergic to latex so I got a variety of non-latex condoms (these, Skin, Bare), and these are the worst according to the man I have sex with.  He doesn't have a problem with using condoms, but he says these feel like \"a rubber tire\" and \"thick plastic.\"  Definitely not his favorite.", 
            "Then last night we used one and it leaked.  Um, the whole purpose of using a condom is for protection!  We used it properly and its expiration isn't until 2014.  So, these are all getting tossed and we'll use other kinds.\n", 
            "\n  Good:", 
            "Super strong, 10 times stronger than the thickest latex condom", 
            "If your of large girth, these run SUPER TIGHT, but its good, because is will almost feel like its not there", 
            "Do to tight fit no bunching up, can be a little hard to take off after.", 
            "Allows you to feel heat, which is a new thing for me when using a condom", 
            "A MUST if you or your partner is allergic to latex or has allergies or issues with that area of the body.", 
            "Works with ALMOST any lube, putting a little inside the condom makes it even better", 
            "Bad:", 
            "IF YOU HAVE ISSUES LASTING during sex, you might want to think about something else.  What I mean is these (any any type of Polyurethane condoms) are so tight, strong and thin, you will swear that your almost not wearing one.  So it will cause you to go out a little faster than with a thick latex condom.", 
            "Rolled super tight from manufacture, and you WILL NEED lube most of the time when using these.  Check out the extra lubed ones if this is a issue.", 
            "If the band hurts will need to get the magnum ones they run tight", 
            "TAKE YOUR TIME PUTTING THEM ON.  The are rolled tight as can be, and because of this the rubber ring can get tangled up when rolling them on.  Either use some lube as you roll them on, or if it gets caught roll it back up a little bit, grab the ring and slowly guide it on.  (if your looking to be smooth, might want to practice before game time, or your will look like a condom rookie)", 
            "More than likely will need some lube, They are rolled up so tight (because of the material) the lube seems to be squeezed out of them.", 
            "OVERALL:", 
            "My favorite condom, we started using them because of allergies, and have never looked back.  I love the heat feeling and she loves the heat and the not there feeling.  The first time we used them, I kept stopping because it felt like it broke.  Best type of condom I've found, and 10 times better than all the ribber, twisted, heating lube stupid stuff out there.\n"

I don't know if my case is different then most people, but I dealt with a severe illness for the last 18 years of my life (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). For anyone not familiar with that illness...you basically feel like you have a severe case of the flu every day, which includes full body muscle aches and pain along with brain fog, poor sleep, non existent sex drive, no energy...and just an overall feeling of frustration.",

After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it.

I went with this variety pack to test out the whole range and have to say they are all worth it!",

The beaded was better than the comfort one. I haven't tried the others in this pack. I am very disappointed.\n",
