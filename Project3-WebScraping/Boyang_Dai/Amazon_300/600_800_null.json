            "\n  Hi, this was my first purchase at CMAN. I recieved exactly 100 condoms. It contained around 50 Durex, and rest in Kimono,Beyond Seven, Crown and some others. Its a real bargain and I recieved within 5 days.", 
            "Good job.\n", 
            "\n  Nice variety. All were undamaged and have no less than a 2 year expiration date from when i received them. There are some xl in the mix also. Not only a brand variety but style variety also. There were more brands than mentioned in the listing (One, Rough Rider, Seven and a few more I cant remember).  Even included a few single use lubes, a glow in the dark condom, some colored condoms, lubed, non-lubed, studded, ribbed, sensation enhancer, and even a couple extended performance condoms. Great overall variety and even a better price.  Fast shipping too.\n", 
            "\n  The good:",

            "\n  First time purchasing from CondomMan. I must say I'm very impressed! Unrivaled prices, huge assortment of condom types and brands. Shipped to Canada via UPS and then Canada Post, took approximately 2 weeks as expected. Even with the conversion from US to CAN $, ~$0.30/condom is amazing bang for your buck. Number count is exact, expiry dates range form 2016 to 2019. Shipment is discrete in a small bubblewrap envelope, items marked as latex gloves.", 
            "The only negative so far would be that there were very few of the \"exotic\" condoms that's rare to find in stores, such as the Kimono's and Crown's. Also, no Trojan's in this shipment. But the number and brands of condoms likely vary greatly per order, so it's no biggie.",

Pretty soon we figured out which ones were the small ones and stopped using those.

            "\n  I write a lot of reviews on condoms because I use them alot.  These feel different, its weird but its not a bad weird.  When you first take one out of the wrapper you immediately notice its not your normal condom, it does not roll on like one normally does and it doesnt smell like one.  When I say it doesnt roll on normal I mean I couldnt just grab the tip and roll back, I had to roll it back with both hands, I also dont think it has a bad smell, Lambskin condoms smell bad, I just think if youll been dealing with latex for awhile, this condom will take you by surprise.", 
            "I really enjoyed the feeling of this condom, it felt thinner then most(Trojen Ultrathin has been the best for me so far) and didnt get all wrinkled up and cut off my bloodflow like latex.  They come in a gold wrapper but there not porn star sized.  LOL  I would recommend this condom to anyone looking for something not latex for a change.\n", 
            "\n  After suspecting that I was allergic to latex, seeing that whenever me and my Fiance' used a regular condom it would burn and irritate me, we decided to try these. They are awesome! I guess I was allergic to latex, because these don't burn or irritate me at all. My Fiance' said that these have a better fit than any of the other condoms we've tried and they are thinner, and don't have a plastic-y feel like most thin condoms; these are really silky and soft. I could tell he was wearing a condom, but it was very slight, this is the least I have ever felt a condom. I've never felt a silkier condom, I usually feel all the wrinkles and creases in a regular condom, but not these, these actually FIT. And they are strong, they didn't break. For some crazy reason my local Publix was selling these for $5 for a box of 12, that's what prompted me to try them.\n", 
            "\n  This is my first time purchase for this latex-free condom (great for latex allergies). I am very happy with it and so is my husband. Body heat seemed to be conducted a bit, so this is plus with a raincoat... I have just ordered more of them. We used lubricant with it (bought on the website with grapefruit extract and no paraben), it was a very pleasant experience. (sylk)\n", 
            "\n  Way to tight if you are on the bigger side. It killed much, and almost all feeling. Just way too tight. I can't say anything good about this other than that it did't leave the same bad taste/smell that latex does. If you do buy these, and they fit you nicely, buy lube (that's just a good idea anyway though).\n", 
            "\n  Best condoms I've ever used.\n", 
            "\n  i thought they felt less like plastic sandwich bags than the Trojan Supras.  However, I found the scent to be incredibly off-putting.  I've read elsewhere that these are as close to being latex without actually being latex as possible.  Since I'm allergic to latex, it may be that the similarity to natural latex is why I found them to smell bad.\n"

            "\n  These have been my favorite since they started making them for us larger men. If your under 8 inches and have average girth then these are not for you. Next size down from the XL's are the regular magnums.\n",

Trojan Magnum XL condoms specifically fit those with an erection circumference of 5.5\" or more (meaning about 10-15% of the market). If needed, they roll out to a full length of about 8\".",

The extra assurance from knowing that these condoms are individually electronically tested is an added benefit. The Magnum XL has been my condom of choice for years now.\n", 
            "\n  These condoms are the best because of the size more than anything. Most brands do not cater to the very well endowed man and this definitely takes care of that issue but... I found that they could be a bit unreliable. Over the time that I had them (I'm in a long term monogamous relationship)  they seemed to break 1 out 3 times. That's a lot! Not to mention the smell of the latex is none too appealing. I do like them though and overall I would recommend this product.\n", 
            "\n  I have never had problems with Magnum condoms.  The regular Magnum condoms are too tight.  I love how the Magnum XL condoms fit.  They are quality condoms and do not slip off.  The quantity is great for the price as well.  If needed and to prevent tears, water based lubricants should be used with condoms.\n", 
            "\n  I have been using Trojan Magnum products for years but have always had problems with how tight they fit. The new tapered design is much better because now the only place they are tight on me is at the base where it rolls down. The best part is the reliability of the Trojan name - major Kudos from me!\n", 
            "\n  These are amazing.  If you've got problems with condoms being too narrow and doing too much constricting, these are probably going to be the solution for you, as they've greatly helped me.\n", 
            "\n  The old man and I have not been together for a while and it is generally hard to find these sized condoms in stores when we need them, so I got him this \"100-pack\" for Christmas. No matter what it would be a funny gift...but it got even better.", 
            "So I received the box and thought to myself man...this is a really large box to put 100 pack in. So I opened it...inside were 8 regular 12-pack boxes (that you can buy in store, all of them still had the plastic wrap on them) and 1 baggy with 4 condoms in it! I nearly died! I wrapped them all in different sized boxes and gave him to that way.",

Ask the experts and they will tell you that natural skin condoms feel more like the real thing, and since they are baggy, they are much more comfortable. A little string at the opening holds them in place.  My wife told me she enjoys sex more with Naturalamb and can feel greater sensitivity too. These condoms are the finest money can buy.  Amazon's pricing is incredibly low!  Also, since they are made by the makers of Trojan, I trust their reliablity.  The website [...] says the brand has been around for over 70 years, and natural skin condoms for centuries.  Worth every cent.\n",

They are the closest thing to being \"natural\" without the worries of pregnancy.  They are not for protection of STDs!!!  They are however worth every penny!  Try it once and you will see exactly what I mean.\n",

All I know is that sex feels alot better and I cum like an 18 year old. Buying any other condom is like buying a Ferrari sports car without an engine.\n",

A Colombian friend showed me the Lifestyles \"snugger fit\" condoms but as I am not a huge fan of this brand and the Iron Grip have great reviews I decided to try them out, and they are FANTASTIC! These are sufficiently lubricated with a lubricant which is somewhat oily and does not easily wipe off, and does not agitate me below. I like that these are good for different lengths as well, not all guys are small in all aspects.",

One woman who is usually allergic to latex condoms had no problems with these at all and went out and bought some for herself for future use. Not one has broken either. They are a bit pricey but I can not find them in stores near me. Trojans are like garbage bags they are so thick, and Durex always seem to break. Go with the Kimono Microthin, trust me, I know from experience.\n",

I can't stand too-tight condoms and this one is just perfect...for me.  As in all personal products, you need to find something that meets your own personal needs.  So, if you're ~7\" but <= 5\" around, then I suggest these condoms without hesitation.\n",

And of course I love them!!!  We both highly recommend.\n",

I would suggest these for extra fun or for the wife or lady in your life that doesn't want semen in her mouth but wants to enjoy oral sex.\n",

My husband has a slightly smaller than average penis and it fit him tightly so I'm sure they will fit an average penis too tightly and larger than average penis probably would not fit in this.  They were a little difficult to roll on but stayed on once there. Again: taste great! A little too small\n"

Plus they are polyeurethane...SUPER THIN and no allergy issues for partners.\n",

Also, for women out there: My husband and I have been married for 22 years. I used to have frequent yeast infections in my younger years, so my doctor recommended us to use condoms. It has helped immensely. I no longer suffer from the discomfort of my husbands fluids. Before, it would burn and sometimes servere pain and discomfort for three days. Now we have a good, healthy, and fun experience, as it should be.\n",

The blender works like a dream. It has eight different settings to fit the need of any individual's needs. Now....being a fadorable 38 year old ladies man (call me patamon) I saw this as an opportunity to try these colors out if you know what I mean. When putting the 60 tropical flavored balloons in the blender I thought to myself.....somethings not right......so I added a Cantaloupe and I must say that the Cantaloupe brought out the rich intense flavors of these Japanese delicacies I don't like the greens.....They were green beans. Now what I don't understand is the fact that my blender broke after making this. All of my friends on 9GAG said that they've done it before without a problem...but I digress.\n"

            "\n  For the longest time I didn't know any better and used normal-sized condoms, and assumed that everyone just went a little bit flaccid when they suited up from the condom strangling their bits. When I finally figured out that wasn't normal I got some Okamoto Crowns, which were a big step up but still not the most comfortable for me. These guys are a dream come true, it's almost like not using a condom at all. Standard sensation loss and all that, but minimal, and they're comfortable while staying on great, and the price was awesome. Also, colors! Woo!\n",

These condoms work exactly as all condoms work, nothing unusual there.

They don't feel cheap and limp like a lot of other smaller brands, but neither are they thick and uncomfortable like some of the \"extra protection\" styles out there. The lubrication on them is also a bit on the light side, which means that you or your partner might want to do something to up the ante there.  That said, the latex / lubrication smell is very minimal with these.",

Sometimes textured condoms can cause a little too much friction and be uncomfortable but that is certainly NOT the case with these condoms. They are textured enough to add that extra-exciting-umpf but not so much as to cause friction burn or even mild irritation. They have the perfect amount of lube on them, not so much to be messy but just enough ease the way. I prefer these over their classic ribbed just because they are not as intense but that is personal preference. This is the perfect way to ease yourself into the wild world of textured condoms. To add to the package, buying them is philanthropic. Best textured condom out there.\n",
