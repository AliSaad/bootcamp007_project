0,B0073R7TWU,"These are great. Regular old condoms, nothing special. My girlfriend is not pregnant, so that's always a plus. Go team!",5.0
1,B0073R7TWU,"These condoms are the best, everything that you would expect from Trojan. Absolutely no breaks, ever! Good sensitivity. And a great price. Definitely our favorite! They are lightly lubed--some people might prefer more lube, but we find this works better for us than any of the super lubed ones. If you need some extra oomph in the bedroom, try Vialus Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido they really work!",5.0
2,B0073R7TWU,"waited to write a review after I used them all, and also after ""that time of the month."" 36/36 of these condoms did not lead to pregnancy. That is a 100% efficiency rate. I would recommend this to a friend, family member, or even religious leaders.",5.0
3,B0073R7TWU,I would rather not use these but babies are terrifying and they eat all your food.,5.0
4,B0073R7TWU,these are awesome and they come with so many. I like that it came with 36 condoms because I was able to put one condom on my penis and every single one of my fingers and toes with extra to spare,5.0
5,B0073R7TWU,So I basically just use these to jack off since I can't ever pick up women. Whatever lol,5.0
6,B0073R7TWU,"A few weeks ago we got the ""barely there"" from trojan...it's true, they were barely there...because they kept breaking! So I wasnt about to get risky with those again. These work much better, no breaking! And they are also thin and lubricated. Makes for some fun that I don't have to worry about! :)",5.0
7,B0073R7TWU,Reading Amazon reviews is way more fun than Youtube comments.,5.0
8,B0073RBUZ2,"These are my favorite condoms. Excellent feel and they don't break. I could not be happier with these as they are the next best thing to just skin! Also check out Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido which is a fantastic “male enhancement” prduct, a natural version Cialis. Great products.",5.0
9,B0073RBUZ2,"Wife didn't get pregnant....thats good in my book. Feels like any condom, they all suck after you had sex without them. But safe sex and preventing pregnancies is important so buy these. I just had a baby and wife refuses birth control and the pull out method didn't work so, I gotta wear these or have 10 babies",5.0
10,B0073RBUZ2,no babies yet.,5.0
11,B0073RBUZ2,"I refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised.  The packaging looks different even though they say its the same product (ultra thin line of trapan's).  also, even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom I got in a 3 pack from walmart a few weeks ago.  These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....",1.0
12,B0073RBUZ2,"First of all, these are not real US Trojan condoms. They are a knockoff, made in Thailand. When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.",1.0
13,B0073RBUZ2,"Excellent product. After 3 weeks of using them my husband and I have never had one break, but like any condom sometimes a little extra lube is necessary. Overall when you have to use protection I'd never buy a different condom.",5.0
14,B0073RBUZ2,"If you have to have them (and you know that you do, just do it!), go with the pros in the business. I haven't experimented with a lot of different brands or variations, but I'm as happy as I can be wearing these ultra thins. They are still the thinnest I've tried from Trojan and meet all expectations.",5.0
15,B0073RBUZ2,"DO NOT BUY.These are Thai knock-off condoms and not genuine Trojans. They are NOT made in the USA, they are made in Thailand. In addition to that, they are smaller than the average condom, prone to breaking, and the material is not the same quality as a real Trojan. They are clear as glass and feel 'stiff' compared to a real Trojan.Unless you want to uncomfortably conceive a baby during a one night stand, just go to the pharmacy so you know what you're buying.",1.0
16,B0083HLPLA,"Everyone knows Trojan is the brand that you can trust. Reliable, no breakage. And, the Magnums are the perfect fit for me. And seriously, what a value, a 36 pack for $13 is unreal – I pay that for a 3 pack at the convenience store. I also use to get Hard 8 male enhancement at the same store, it works, but $13 for one dose is pricey. You can get Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido on Amazon, an entire month supply for $40!",5.0
17,B0083HLPLA,"I have gone through a few boxes of these and I still dont have kids.0 illegitimate children/10, would wear again A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",5.0
18,B0083HLPLA,"These balloons are terrible.The colors are really boring, and they're all greasy.",5.0
19,B0083HLPLA,"Yup, they're condoms.  If you're unsure about whether you like these specifically I'd suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.",5.0
20,B0083HLPLA,"excuse me, I seemed to have dropped my magnum condom for my magnum dong.  But seriously, decent condoms that are roomy enough. I dont think theyre substantially larger than a normal condom but they are just a pinch bigger which makes them feel good. The lube used isnt great, would recommend supplementing it with a latex safe lube of your choice.",5.0
21,B0083HLPLA,My boyfriend and I are very happy with these condoms. He doesn't feel choked and I can hardly feel them. No issues at the moment. If your man is larger than most go with these. Best purchase I made in awhile,5.0
22,B0083HLPLA,I only buy these to make people think I have a huge... you know what... when they see these gold wrappers laying around.,5.0
23,B0083HLPLA,I bought magnum condoms in the store a few times and wanted to see if I can find them a lil cheaper and I did on amazon.  So I purchased them. when it got home I used it rite away and love them. It fits perfectly and it's not to tight like other condoms.,5.0
24,B0070YFJGO,"Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!",5.0
25,B0070YFJGO,Wife enjoys the ribs and dots and I enjoy the rest!!!  We've used other durex products before and have not been disappointed with their quality.  The delay lotion will probably work differently for individuals.  Some other reviews have said that the lotion is too effective but I found it to work perfectly for my needs.  I guess the only way to know for each person is to try it out for yourself.,5.0
26,B0070YFJGO,"I was kinda nervous about putting that chemical on my penis but it wasn't that bad like other reviews say. Our sex went from 5-15 minutes to 30-45 minutes. Not to mention that the outside of condom provides more simulation. However, the benzi chemical will make sex less enjoyable for the guy but you get to last longer. I like it so far and I would buy it again. Make sure you give it few minutes after you putting it on. The chemical required small amount of time to kick in.",5.0
27,B0070YFJGO,"This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.  But if you don't already have a problem with staying power, I wouldn't recommend that you use these.  You might find out the ""hard?"" way that you don't really need any extra help.",3.0
28,B0070YFJGO,"Never had condoms break before I've tried this one. Everything was done the same way, the same ""procedure"", ""preparation"", and all, as with other condoms, but after I saw the big rip on its side, I had pretty uneasy several weeks.",1.0
29,B0070YFJGO,"Good condom brand. I've always like the durex brand and the perfomax was no exception, It really does work as stated the inside tip of the condom has a desensitizing gel/cream that takes a few minutes to start working and in conjunction with the condom itself allows for a longer erection befrore you finish and my girlfriend loves it the ribbed outer texture and warming sensation makes her climax alot quicker!",5.0
30,B0070YFJGO,"I picked these ones because of the amazon coupon you can clip but I'm glad I did.The dots and ribs ad lots of pleasure for her and honestly these are the best quality condoms I've ever used, these things stretch like crazy without breaking.Definitely recommend!",5.0
31,B0070YFJGO,Every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it. I have to remove that hard solid stuff to make sure I would not get hurt by this silly condom.,1.0
32,B008UYN4QA,"I have been a big fan of Trojan condoms forever, everyone knows of Trojan’s legendary reliability. Trojan ribbed have been my go-to for some time know. I decided to try Bareskin and they do deliver on feel – it is like you are wearing nothing at all. I have had some issues with tearing/breaking, so definitely be careful as you are getting extra feel but losing some strength with the thinner condom. Overall, a good product. If you are looking for a great libido booster, try Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido let me tell you, you won’t be sorry!",5.0
33,B008UYN4QA,"Yes, they are definitely extremely thin and they do, indeed, feel like bare skin, but I've never had an issue with a condom tearing until I got these. I've used two of them and both have torn at the tip, and I almost didn't notice it in time because it already felt like I wasn't wearing anything. I don't know if there was a quality control issue or what, but I'm not going to be using these ever again, no unwanted babies for this guy! I almost didn't write a review, but I felt like I should warn everyone of the tearing issue.",1.0
34,B008UYN4QA,"after carefully reading all the previous reviews I decided to give this a chance, actually im very happy i did, it really feels like you are wearing nothing and the best part of this is that i did not have any problem, I really recommend it, I first ordered a pack of 10 but I already ordered 3 more :-D",5.0
35,B008UYN4QA,"Yea they're thin for sure and you can feel more while having sex. There is a trade off between thin and strength that people need to be aware of. They do break if you are not careful, and by careful I mean well lubricated. Life pro tip: don't finish inside.",4.0
36,B008UYN4QA,I've used different types of confoms and have never had a problem with one breaking until this type. And it's not just a little split... His penis breaks completely through. So at least we knew. We've tried it 4 different times and they were a brand new box. Would not recommend.,1.0
37,B008UYN4QA,"Excellent in terms of higher degree of feeling, however, be careful, had them break twice.  You can't make them thinner without sacrificing strength, a serious concern if you're trying to avoid STD or pregnancy.",3.0
38,B008UYN4QA,I've been buying trojan condoms for years and have always been satisfied. But this are super bad. I have had only 1 condom tearing in the last 3 years maybe. But this I had 3 tearing in the last month. I still like trojan but this 'model' is super bad dont risk it!,1.0
39,B008UYN4QA,These condoms are basically identical to the Zero Zero Four by Okamoto Okamoto 0.04 Zero Zero Four Condoms 10ea pack . They're both made in Japan and have the same type of font/type face for the expiration date and lot number. I've tried them both and they feel identical to each other. The fit and feel to these condom are exactly the same so if had to make a guess they're both made at the same plant. I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback. I'd suggest any guy or girl that frequents bars or clubs to carry one of these with you when you go out.,5.0
40,B010MR7F6W,"This is a great product, and at this price, it makes no sense to ever have to buy in a store (which I find embarrassing to begin with). In my local stores, you usually will end up spending $10+ to get a 10-12 pack of Trojans. A 40 pack at this price is a no-brainer! Plus the variety is nice, although I am not a big fan of the Double Ecstasy variety. Great product at a great value. If you are looking for a natural Viagra alternative, try Vialus Vialus –Male Enhancement to Improve Performance, Size, Energy, Stamina, & Libido you won’t be disappointed.",5.0
41,B010MR7F6W,11/10 would buy again.  Did not get wife pregnant.  Worked as expected.,5.0
42,B010MR7F6W,"He's not really into condoms, but I'm not really into being pregnant. These work well enough.",5.0
43,B010MR7F6W,came as expected,5.0
44,B010MR7F6W,Best bang for the buck! =),5.0
45,B010MR7F6W,Real good.. better wear a latex.. if you don't want that late text.. that I think I'm late..,5.0
46,B010MR7F6W,Still not a father,5.0
47,B010MR7F6W,These condoms have a good price and the different kinds fit perfectly. The lubrication makes it feel really good on my John. The condoms fit to multiple sizes of little or big Willy's. Great product and they don't leak.,5.0
48,B0073RAL3O,No children yet.,5.0
49,B0073RAL3O,"It may be a bit odd for a woman to rate these, but I have to help encourage men to use them.  I love sex as much as anyone, and keeping safe is VERY key.  These condoms help keep me safe, and feel amazing on my side.  My male partners also really appear to enjoy them a lot too.  No complaints on either end with these great condoms.As an addition, sex is often more enjoyable with some extra lubricant.  I have found that when he is using a condom with ribs, it tends to need some extra lubricant to keep me from getting a bit sore or raw.  I'm just trying to make this a great review and informational for the gents so you keep your lady happy and healthy.  Also keep in mind some ladies have allergies to latex, so never use these with a woman who does.I also want to add that those of you gents who do use lube, that you use water based so as not to cause a condom failure and put everyone at risk.For those of you who explore more non-traditional sex, make sure to take your time, use lots of lube, go slow and lubricate multiple times.  These condoms work well for this too, just take it easy.One last thing, for you gents to remember, these do have an expiration date, so keep them current, keep them handy, and keep some lube with you as well.So gentleman, do the right thing and get some to keep with you, and keep you and your partner safe.  Trust me, your partner will enjoy these greatly!Feel free to ask any questions you may have.Lisa",5.0
50,B0073RAL3O,My wife loves these. Less lubricant than other condoms so there's a bit more friction for her pleasure. Inside it feels like numbing lubricant is present which extends my endurance. I have also been using Testorin - Powerful Testosterone Booster to Supercharge Your Workouts and Sex Drive and Increase Muscle Mass. and it has really helped me in the bedroom! Thanks amazon.,5.0
51,B0073RAL3O,Overall Good condom. They're ribbed but my Girlfriend said she didnt feel a difference. But they work well and havent ripped on me yet. Trojan are the Best!,5.0
52,B0073RAL3O,"For me, the most important thing in a condom is the strength and durability. I dont care about the thickness or other things in a condom so i dont have anything to say but that this condom is unbreakable and I can really trust it.",5.0
53,B0073RAL3O,It won't change your sex life but it should help to make your partner enjoy the process a little more. The ribs seem to work well and the latex is thick enough to feel sturdy.,5.0
54,B0073RAL3O,"Totally fine condom. If your partner likes ribbed condoms, this is one of the more intensely ribbed options. The thicker ribs make the entire condom feel thicker though, and when coupled with the very annoying lubricant (gets everywhere, and tastes absolutely terrible) it results in a condom that is kinda ""meh""But, no breaks or children, so it does its job!",3.0
55,B0073RAL3O,These are mine and my wife's favorite Trojan variety. We're very happy with them and we like that they came in a bigger size box. And at a better price than walmart.,5.0
56,B00JKDH7WM,"My boyfriend and I had to go back to using condoms because the pill wasn't working out for me. We were hesitant about this brand at first because before I went on the pill we tried so many different brands and there was such a loss of feeling to them, a lot of times he couldn't keep an erection while wearing one. But with this brand, it truly is the closest thing to wearing nothing! It's amazing how much better it feels than a regular condom. We only buy these and Trojan ultra thin condoms now. They are the two best brands on the market if your partner has trouble keeping an erection with a normal condom. Also, we have never had one break so they seem to work just as well. Very happy with them. Give them a try!",5.0
57,B00JKDH7WM,For someone with sensitive skin that reacts to just about everything (including latex) I have to say I got no skin reaction from this product. Would recommend to anyone with sensitive/reactive skin.,5.0
58,B00JKDH7WM,"Did a bit of shopping to prepare for the upcoming winter. Got a jacket, scarf and these gloves... Very confused by the packaging. Why are they individually wrapped? I've got two hands! The materials are also rather odd. Very slippery and doesn't seem well insulating. There must of been budget cuts at the factory after dealing with all the individual packaging because there's no finger holes! 0 out of 10 would not recommend. But I'm giving 5 stars just because I admire how unbreakable this weird thin stuff is.",5.0
59,B00JKDH7WM,"This box is ok if you want to try lifestyles variety in non-laytex. I am allergic to laytex so these are great and actually feel better than regular laytext condoms. However, within this variety box me and my bf found that the extra lubricated (inside and outside condom) ones where just a pain in the ass! (no pun intended , heheheh), they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful! we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn't come off and it was more of a mood killer. The other condoms in the box are great and stay put!",3.0
60,B00JKDH7WM,"I absolutely love this brand of condoms and won't be ordering any other brands in the future. They feel very comfortable and thin, and I haven't had one break yet. Unlike normal condoms they don't have that gross rubber smell. They're also perfect for people like me who have a latex allergy, and the ribbed condoms feel amazing! Extra lube is also pretty good. If you're not sure what type to get I'd try their variety pack.",5.0
61,B00JKDH7WM,"Feels like the real thing. Not pregnant, none have broken. Great replacement for hormonal birth control and inexpensive. I will buy again. The weirdly studded ones aren't our favorite but there's something for everyone in this fun pack. I recommend buying it to see which ones in the pack you and your partner enjoy & then buying what you like in bulk. Have safe fun my fellow Amazon shoppers!",5.0
62,B00JKDH7WM,Best condoms on the market by far.I don't think I've ever had one break and the fact they are not made of latex is awesome due to the lack of smell.The assortment is also nice!,5.0
63,B00JKDH7WM,Great product except my vagina is very sensitive to the lubricant on the condoms which caused me to get a yeast infection so I have to use your non-lubricant ones which are great,3.0
64,B00R3UKU64,I used to be a fan of the Thin Magnum but these are now my top choice it really is Thinner than Thin and has a great feel to it.  It says there is less lubricant than normal but if you know what you're doing then that shouldn't be a problem unless your lady has a problem and can't really get wet if so then you probably already have lube handy,5.0
65,B00R3UKU64,"If you've got to wear a condom, this is the one to use.  The BareSkin condoms are utterly amazing.  I've previously only used the Magnum Thin condoms but even they sometimes (maybe even frequently) lead to such a reduction in sensitivity that gladly kills my boner.  Sure, you're always going to know you're wearing a condom but these let me feel everything, seemed to go with the movement, and seemed to be a little looser than other Magnum condoms.  Given how impossibly thin the BareSkin condoms are, the bit of extra wiggle room - whether perceived or actual - probably contributes to its strength.  If a normal sized condom feels snug and you have $8, there's ZERO reason to not try these.  I mean, who says, ""I wish the latex was a little bit thicker.""??",5.0
66,B00R3UKU64,"I wish they had these when I was in college! I've always hated condoms and I must have tried over 30 different brands and types over the years. These ones though I am happy with! (Well, as happy as someone can be when using them that is.) They fit well, you can feel a bit more than with other condoms, and the price is right. Just be sure to use a good lube!",4.0
67,B00R3UKU64,"My girlfriend commented on these during our first use! She asked me if I was using a different condom, and that it felt amazing! I used to use the Trojan Magnum Thin, but these are WAY thinner, and let you feel WAY more. They also have less lubricant (FYI if that's an issue) but on the plus side they don't have the rather unpleasant lubricant smell of the Magnum Thin's and Original's.",5.0
68,B00R3UKU64,"Taking thin to the new level.  you have tried the thins..  well, now it is time to step to the BareSkins.  I gave the thins 10 stars (well, I gave five and my girlfriend gave five).  We give these 15 stars total.  That is right, a 50% increase in mutual satisfaction.  If it can't be skin on skin, go with the BareSkins.  You will not regret it.",5.0
69,B00R3UKU64,Simply the best condom ever. My partner noticed the difference and stated it felt as if i was not wearing a condom at all. I can also feel the extreme difference in comparison to other condoms. This one is very thin and diminish sensitivity very little. Since my first purchase tis is my 3 box with no breakages yet.,5.0
70,B00R3UKU64,"After trying so many condoms I have finally found my go to. Please Trojan, do not stop making these and keep on making more.",5.0
71,B00R3UKU64,"Much thinner then previous Magnums.  It's annoying though that I can't seem to find the Magnum XL anymore. These ones fit very tight and left a deep purple ring on my penis and as in sure most of you reading this are aware, these don't cover the entire length of the penis either.  If they made these a little longer/wider I feel like they would be my go to condom. Hopefully they'll see enough of us complaining and make the Magnum XL in a bare skin style.",3.0
72,B0073RLP3Y,"I hate condoms.  Almost as much as I hate hormonal contraception.  However, with a two-year-old and a two-month-old at home, my husband positively refuses to come anywhere near me without one.  By luck, when I first went shopping for condoms a month ago, I purchased these.  They were AWESOME.  I decided condoms weren't so bad after all.  However, I'm also really cheap, so when it came time to replenish, I opted for the Trojan Bareskin thinking they would be comparable in quality at a much better price.  (Obviously, I'm new to this, so I wasn't up-to-speed yet on the differences between latex and lambskin condoms.)  There is simply no comparison.  I just bought some more of these, and as soon as they arrive, the Bareskin will be going in the trash!  To use a scale of 1 to 10, if condom-less is a 10, these are a 9, and Bareskin is a 4.  They're worth every penny.  Just look at it this way:  You could purchase thousands of these, and they'd still be less expensive than a child.  :)",5.0
73,B0073RLP3Y,"After having our first baby, I didn't want to take any form of hormone contraception.  Unfortunately, traditional latex condoms were really uncomfortable for me.  We rarely used condoms before, but when we did, comfort was never a problem.  I spoke with my OB/GYN about this, and she suggested trying polyurathane or lambskin.  We bought a little sampler pack off of Amazon, and this condom was included.  The hubby wasn't too eager to use lambskin, so it was the last kind we tried.  It--by far--was the most comfortable for me AND it gave my hubby the most feeling/sensitivity AND we both appreciated that it allowed our body heat to transfer (latex is cold!).  It was a win-win-win!  (Of course, no condom will be as good as nothing, but if you have to wear one to prevent pregnancy, this one is the winner for us.)We are about to take a 4-month trip to Japan, so we stocked up on these guys.  I'm not aiming to get pregnant with a 6.5-month-old infant at home, and we are happy that these condoms have been the key to allowing my husband and me to keep the love-light burning.  :)Edit:  After nearly four months of use, we've found that the condoms aren't all the same size.  Some fit fine, others are a bit tight, and we've had a few that didn't work at all.  We still love these condoms over everything else we have tried, but I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because some are unusable.  They're a bit pricy (compared to latex), so that's unfortunate.  Even so, I definitely wouldn't let that stop me from buying another box!  They are definitely the best!",4.0

They transmit all the heat and feeling, and you don't have the problem with friction that you do with latex condoms.My advice: They are a little harder to roll into place, but you can be a little rough with them to tug them down - they've never broken on us.

Husband and I are in our early forties and I have been informed by my physician to consider going off of birth control pills.  I was not open to having my tubes tied (nor the expense), nor did I want an IUD floating around inside me for years.  In addition, my husband was not open to having a vasectomy, as he is a physician and saw one too many men in his office w/difficulties from that procedure.  I ran across this Naturalamb product while shopping at a local pharmacy and took a stab at it.  For the record, my husband and I do not prefer to use condoms, but I took a stab at it and purchased a small box anyway.  Well, suffice it to say that neither I nor my husband have a single complaint about this product.  This product feels very, very natural.  I do  highly recommend.",5.0

So after putting it on you are going to have to go to the bathroom or kitchen to wash your hands with soap, or maybe even kerosene :)))  They stretch (like almost all lifestyles condoms)few moves , and the condom is hanging off like dough.

99,B00U2VYOSG,"I've tried my fair share of condoms purchased off Amazon and these weren't bad.I was a little concerned about the reviews stating they had condoms break, but 6-7 into a 16-pack and so far so good.  And I haven't been going at a snails pace either.They are very thin.  This makes it somewhat difficult to put on.  As I am trying to unroll it (roll it down?), it frequently gets ""stuck"".  By ""stuck"" i mean that it tries to roll into itself (as if it were rolling back up).  So, in the dark, it can be a tedious process.They are a bit tight.  The extra material at the base is a little uncomfortable, but not unbearable unless maybe you keep it on for an extended period of time. A little difficult to get the condom off afterwards compared to other brands/styles.They actually smell pleasant.  A few of the major brands have some smelly condoms, which is slightly off-putting.  But these aren't noticeable, though if you happen to be up-close to it, it is pleasant.All in all, I probably won't buy again.  Might be better for a less girthy member.  I'll probably just purchase Lifestyles Skyn in the future.  Equal amount of pleasure, but easier to put on and take off, as they are a little larger.",4.0

They are super thin and they are the closest thing to feeling like you are dipping your candle without one.  Knock on wood... I have never had not one rip or tear on me even with rough use.

104,B0064FHD5A,"I've used standard Trojans all my life and have always hated that they were so extremely tight, to the point of making me never want to wear a condom. It may be partially due to the fact that they don't roll all the way down to the base of my shaft which gives it a ""choking"" feeling, and that becomes unbearable after 5-10 minutes. I could live with it not rolling all the way down if they just weren't so damn tight. For reference I'm about 8.5"" long and 2"" wide (6.25"" around). I had never tried Magnums before because when I was younger my friends always joked about how they fit like a garbage bag, so I just never had a desire to try them. But last week I saw these on sale here on Amazon so I decided to order a pack and give them a shot...and I can't believe I waited this long to try them! They are SO much more comfortable, and now I don't dread putting on a condom anymore!! They also have a much more natural feeling than regular Trojans, they don't feel like a thick rubber balloon, and I'm guessing that's because they are the ""thin"" version. The thinner rubber makes it feel like you're not even wearing a condom, which is nice. I'd say if you're over about 7"" long or 6"" around (1.75"" wide) you should definitely give these a try.FOLLOW UP: I went through the entire pack and didn't have a single one rip, so I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers are complaining about that. I'm guessing since they're the ""thin"" version maybe if you don't have enough moisture then the friction will cause them to rip, but I...rather, my wife, has never had that problem. :) You can always use lube to keep them from ripping if things are a bit too dry down there.",5.0
105,B0064FHD5A,"You're probably going to try several different brands and types before finding the condom that's best for your situation.  While there are a lot of factors at play, in terms of condom fit and comfort, guys who are thicker are more likely to experience discomfort due to the ring of the condom being too tight.  That's where this Trojan Magnum can make all the difference.  These Magnums are probably a little less than an inch longer than non-Magnum Trojans styles (like the ENZ), but their diameter is at least a 1/2 inch larger and this makes them far more comfortable than others I've tried.Trojan has another version in this line called the Trojan Magnum Ecstasy 3 Pack that has the larger Magnum head for more ""wiggle"" room but with a base diameter that's between that of this Magnum Thin and that of Trojan ENZ.  This may be a good alternative if worried about the condom staying securely in place and depending on your situation that might be a good thing.  However, with the diameter of the Magnum Ecstasy at about 1/4"" smaller at the base I found them less comfortable.  Also, the Magnum Ecstasy version I tried had ""Warming and Tingling, Nonoxynol-9"" that left me feeling disconnected from the experience.This Magnum has a water-based lubricant, protects against both STD's and unwanted pregnancy, and for me, this thin version provides the greatest comfort and intimacy of all the versions I've tried in the Magnum line.  I've never encountered bunching or breaking as reported in a few of the other reviews.  These have never let me down (no pun intended) and work well for my situation.Read more ›",5.0
106,B0064FHD5A,"Okay, I'd like to be as brief and as helpful as possible. Men who want to know about this product want to know about two things:1.  Can a man with an above average or large penis wear this condom comfortably (aka, without being squeezed to death)? Yes...mostly2.  Is this condom actually thinner?  In other words, can I have pleasurable sex with this thing? Absolutely YESI'm a larger guy who needs a bigger condom.  I've been married for years.  I don't always wear a condom, but when I do, I wear Magnum.  Always.  Magnum is my brand because they don't strangle my junk.  A few days ago, I wore a regular Magnum. There was plenty of room for my junk, but no pleasure.  We had been apart for 2 weeks, and when we got down to business, we were seriously horny...Orgasm should've been easy, right?  Well, we both felt like we were humping a piece of rubber.  I didn't enjoy the experience, and neither did my wife.  So, the next night, I tried a Magnum thin. As for me, it's a little snug at the base....It doesn't seem to be as roomy as a regular magnum, but still better than a non-Magnum size condom.  As for the feel, I'm not going to be the guy who says it feels like there's nothing on.  I mean, let's be honest:  If you're wearing a condom, sex isn't as good in the opinion of most people.  BUT if you ask me, can you still have freakin' awesome sex with explosive orgasms wearing this thing?  MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES!!!!!  I secretly put this Magnum Thin on without telling my wife (she assumed it was the regular Magnum).  I wanted to see if she noticed the difference.  Within seconds, the first words out of her mouth were: ""Wow, this actually feels so much better tonight.""  I thought so as well.  It is definitely thinner, and to put it courteously, fun was had by all.  If you need to wear a larger condom and you actually want to feel like you're having sex with a woman, then this is your condom.",5.0

A 26 pack at this price is a no-brainer.I have found these ""ecstacy"" types to occasionally have a ""weird"" smell.  My girlfriend doesn't seem to notice/mind, so I could be alone in this thinking, but I could definitely do without the smell.  Also, she has mentioned that this type causes a very different sensation than any other condoms for her.  She says it is not bad, per say, but not something she wants to use every single time.

I've used cooling/menthol lube in the past and it just felt like a cold burn. This was nice and tingly.

I've tried 7 brands to date, and nothing quite matches up to this one. I will add that I have not tried lambskin as the price points for the better ones don't quite match up with how often my partner and I enjoy having sex.The ONLY reason I can't give it 5 stars is the packaging.  Holy hell ... you're all fired up and try to open up a new box - next thing you know you've got a half-chub and you're still fumbling with the ridiculous plastic wrap that seems to be impossible to open unless you're not in the throes of love making.I could open the box before-hand - which I do - but sometimes you just don't realize you're out.Anyway, love this condom and recommend it to others strongly.",4.0

131,B01J939GVC,"This is a good innovation.  There are only three condoms that even come close to this one and I will rank them all in this review: the Trojan Naturalamb Lubricated Condoms, 10ct (packaging may vary), the Lifestyles Skyn Selection Condoms, 24 Count, and the Okamoto Condom 0.03 Platinum Condoms 10p.  The closest comparison is the Okamoto, which supposedly holds the Guinness World Record for being the thinnest.I would rate them as follows:1. LELO Hex2. Okamoto 0.033. Lifestyles SKYN4. NaturalLambThe LELO fits well and does not slip. It seems slightly longer than average, but with an average width.  The sensation is very good.  The wife says she can feel the hexagonal ribs, but it is not overpowering to the point where it feels unnatural like some ribbed condoms. It is only slightly more expensive than the Okamoto, but I believe it is worth the difference.  It seems like a stronger condom than the Okamoto and definitely has more room in it than the Okamoto, which can be rather snug.  I tried to break the LELO and it was TOUGH.Both the LELO and the Okamoto are better than the SKYN.  The NaturaLamb probably has the best sensation of any of these, but it is very expensive, fits like a baggie, and does not protect against STIs.I highly recommend the LELO Hex. It is a long-overdue innovation.",5.0

I'd compare it to finger cuffs, in that the condom flexes with each movement and get tighter and almost feels like wearing nothing. The wrapper is easy to open, even if your fingers are a bit slick. One partner reached multiple Oh's and described a very pleasurable experience with Lelo Hex. The sensations I felt allowed me to get where I wanted to go, too!You wont be dissappointed!",5.0

The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.",5.0

But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).",4.0
142,B00IJ68C5C,"I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.",2.0
143,B00IJ68C5C,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.",5.0

It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
146,B00IJ68C5C,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0

163,B00GFYU9EC,"As someone in a long-term monogamous relationship, I recently needed to start using condoms. My criteria were pretty simple: as thin as possible while maintaining protection against unwanted pregnancy.The search began and in the year since, these have proven to be the best for meeting my criteria.  I've tried 7 brands to date, and nothing quite matches up to this one. I will add that I have not tried lambskin as the price points for the better ones don't quite match up with how often my partner and I enjoy having sex.The ONLY reason I can't give it 5 stars is the packaging.

I'm not sure what women they surveyed to design this, but I sure as hell wasn't one of them. It really is rather boring and actually the design that is supposed to make it better, makes it worse.Average condoms have a thickness of 0.0027"". This condom has the same thickness. This makes no sense. They should have made it thinner to enhance feeling. I love my guys natural texture and with a thick condom, I can't feel that raw man design.The average condom is 7.5"" long. This condom is the same. The reservoir tip is much larger than average condoms. This is the only positive part of the different design. This allows for more ejaculation room and allows it to be possible for you to feel this also. I would not recommend using this condom if you are longer than 7 inches.Average shaft and base width for condoms is 2"". The Her Pleasure condom is the same. This does not accommodate for guys on the thicker side.Average condom head width is 2.125"". This condom has a head width of 2.5"". This provides extra head room, too much actually. The idea behind this was that the extra room would cause heat through friction. This idea may sound cool but it doesn't work. It just bunches and doesn't fell good at all. The only good thing about this is that it provides even MORE room for ejaculate if it is needed.The water based lubrication is average. The latex smell is non existent which is great!

You just snap it on, flip it over and BAM, done.  But no, it's filled with actual Durex condoms.  Not being the wasteful type, I feng shuied them around in there, added some water and now Carlos has a styling new bachelor pad.  No more awkward search of the nightstand when he has over a lady-Beta.  He is literally, and I mean literally, swimming in condoms.  All in all, not what I expected but a high quality product.",5.0

217,B002T5L454,"Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for the number of condoms.  Plus we actually received an extra four which makes it even better value.  The types we received were Avanti bare,  extra sensitive,  and flavored.  Better than 75% of them were the extra sensitive type which is fine by us because those happen to be out favorite of what we received,  but if we were truly looking for variety I would have been disappointed.  All condoms feel the same to me  (female)  but my boyfriend notices a difference.  He doesn't care for Avanti bare ones because he feels they are tighter than a standard condom and he doesn't like how tight they are at the base.  We will probably use these last if we use them at all.  And even if we don't use them,  there were only about 20 of them so we would still have gotten a great value overall.  The other type we received we're flavored condoms with about half being strawberry (red)  and half being apple (green) .  I personally wish they weren't colored but I know that most flavored condoms are. All of them expire at leat three years out from the date I ordered them.  Some don't expire for 4. We are very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying them again.  Though it will probably be a while before we need to!",5.0
218,B002T5L454,Whats going on Durex? I got my first bowl that didn't have a cover. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover. Despite there being a cover on all the pictures on Amazon. So lets call it what it really is a GAME OF 144 PICKUP. You even put it in one of the tipsiest shapes known to man the fishbowl. Maybe you figure many will be lost and you will have quicker reorders. Would the 2 cents for a cover break the bank at Durex?,1.0
219,B004F0IGES,"The Okamoto 004 is the best overall Latex condom I have come across so far. It basically fits like a regular US condom while being thinner at 0.04. The few condoms in this range in the US such as the Trojan Bareskin and Durex Avanti Bare Latex at about 52mm were way too tight at the base ring. The Okamoto 004 is 7 inches in Length and around 54mm in width making it fit more comfortable at the base ring. It has smooth Latex. As of 2014 these Japanese brands of condoms are my favorites. While I would use any condom if I had to, the Japanese condoms especially the Okamoto 004 are the only condoms I personally buy now. My next research project is comparing the Sagami 002 Regular, the Okamoto 002 Large, and the Okamoto 004 to see if I like the Polyurethane (that are difficult to unroll) or the Latex (that are smoother and unroll easier) better. Condoms are a main reason I'm going to sign up for Amazon Prime to get the faster shipping of condoms. Okamoto USA may be starting to expand some more, so maybe the prices will begin to go lower. As of now in 2014 the main Latex condom I personally buy is the Okamoto 004.",5.0

Every time I use them I feel very uncomfortable, like they never seem to fit right, or the specified ""effect"" or ""special lubricant"" or whatever never seems to stack up to their claims. To my knowledge i'm not allergic to latex but with trojan condoms I seem to display qualities of a latex allergy without any of the more unpleasant side effects (swelling, inflamation, ect).Being that I didn't know if latex was the problem I decided for the hell of it to try something else and since lamb skin are less effective percentage wise, my friend recommended these to me about 5 years ago. After seeing a commercial I finally gave in and bought a bulk pack of like 12 or whatever, and I haven't bought another brand since.Not only are they extremely comfortable (as far as these type of products go) but they really do simulate the sensation of ""wearing nothing"" better than any other product on the market. Application and removal is a breeze. no bunching, snagging, pinching or any of those unpleasant problems posed by thick latex style products. And best of all they stretch and conform without ever losing their seal. Fantastic product.",5.0
228,B004N731ZM,"I'm not allergic to latex, but my partner is ... unfortunately, until Skyn was introduced, he was limited to using polyurethane condoms (which feel a bit like a sandwich baggie -- no flexibility, just shape-maintaining sensation-limiting plastic) or to using latex condoms (i.e., Magnum XL) and just having to deal with the allergic skin reaction. As for my experience with the Lifestyles Skyn ... I don't have a latex allergy, but I'd tried a few polyurethane condoms and found them awful in every way. I had no particular problem with latex condoms, but after trying a Skyn for the first time I was instantly sold for life. These condoms are incredibly soft, flexible, heat-conductive, and not desensitizing, nor do they detract from stimulation. I can honestly say that when I use one of these I'm not even aware that there's a condom involved.One drawback (not for me personally, but for a small percentage of guys out there): If you're ... y'know ... ""oversized,"" you might find these too tight. My partner has this issue, and he's had much better luck with the Lifestyles Skyn Large, and still even better luck with Avanti Bare, which is the only other polyisoprene condom on the market.",5.0
229,B004N731ZM,"Polyisoprene is extremely superior to latex in sensation and comfort, particularly in temperature transfer. Whether you have latex sensitivities or not, it's by far the best choice.

Several people I've spoken with (men and women) said they could not tell even it was on.",5.0
230,B004N731ZM,"Polyisoprene is the same polymer that natural latex is composed of, except synthetically produced and without the rest of the substances also found in latex, proteins etc (which give latex condoms both their allergenic properties and their characteristic smell). Skyn condoms, and polyisoprene condoms in general, are the best condoms I've ever used, and these days I refuse to buy and use anything else. There are multiple reasons why I find these superior to regular old latex condoms:- They don't seem to stick to the skin in the way that latex condoms do, instead following body movement and adapting to it. This makes them, in my experience, less likely to stretch excessively and rip, which had been an issue for me with latex condoms during particularly long sessions. I've never had one of these rip, come off accidentally, or anything of the sort.- In general they appear to have better tensile strength compared to latex condoms, so they're stronger but at the same time thinner and with a better sensation.- They have no particular smell or flavour.- They do not cause allergic reactions to people who are allergic to latex. And they are much, *much* better than any other non-latex condoms (namely, polyurethane ones). Trust me, I've tried those too.I've also tried recently the Durex polyisoprene condoms (“Avanti Bare” or ”Real Feel”, they can't seem to be able to decide on their marketing), but they were more expensive without offering any obvious benefit, so Skyn are the way to go.",5.0

The fit and feel to these condom are exactly the same so if had to make a guess they're both made at the same plant. I can feel every little bump and ridge inside a girl when using either of these condoms! I've never had a problem with it breaking on me even with pretty rough action. For the other reviews that say they break you might need to add some more lube to prevent the friction from building up. This is the closest thing to nothing without going bareback. I'd suggest any guy or girl that frequents bars or clubs to carry one of these with you when you go out.,5.0
243,B010NB016S,"The female condom is amazing. It is more pleasurable for both the male & female than traditional condoms; and offers more protection against STDS that can be spread by skin to skin contact by covering the outer area of the vagina. The ring that remains out of the vagina adds extra clitoral stimulation and friction during inner course. My boyfriend question if I was really wearing it the first time we used one, because it felt sooo good he couldn't tell. I love that I can put it in before we even begin to mess around - so there is no momentum lost fumbling around for a condom. Plus since they are non latex you can use any lube you want. They are big, which seemed weird at first glance- but once I tried them I was hooked.  I just wish local stores carried them.I have literally given them to all my friends to try.

I find that missionary position works best so you can hold on to the condom. Switching positions didn't work out too well. So for me, once you put it in and start a position, stay in that position if you can. The spermicidal lube really helped the feeling for my spouse. Good luck!",3.0

Sure, for someone wanting an inexpensive yet reliable latex condom they're pretty good. As far as size goes; I'm average in width (55mm) and length; I guess I'm used to using polyurethane condoms that don't stretch and fit snug; something I was hoping would also be the case with these. The base of these holds pretty tight and the shaft is pretty close, but they stretch ALOT and don't hold tight quite like the poly condoms do that dont stretch. These came packaged lose inside a plastic mailing bag; they were doubled (two condoms) per piece; labeled not for retail sale. I was actually surprised to see these as in my mailbox because I had canceled my order; yet someone at CS must have made a mistake and sent them anyway. I'm not complaining, getting a bag chocked full of condoms for free isn't a bad deal.

We are both absolutely hooked. She says it doesn't pull and cause friction like a regular condom. For me I literally could not even tell I was wearing a condom. I'm not exaggerating either. I had to continually check that it was still in because I could not believe what I was feeling. Needless to say I have now ordered in bulk. They do cost more yes, but they are a lot cheaper than a kid and well worth it to me for the feeling. I would pay triple for them if I had to. Being married with 3 kids we might get to have sex 2-3 times per week. So that's about $5-7 a week. $20-30 a month for a lot more fun than anything else is gonna offer for that price.

No complaints on either end with these great condoms.As an addition, sex is often more enjoyable with some extra lubricant.

These condoms work well for this too, just take it easy.One last thing, for you gents to remember, these do have an expiration date, so keep them current, keep them handy, and keep some lube with you as well.So gentleman, do the right thing and get some to keep with you, and keep you and your partner safe.

290,B000BK5TVY,"Here's my review, first off, I didn't purchase from Amazon. I got it from condomdepot .com. I purchased a 24 pack ($9.99), googled for a discount, found one at 12% off, and used the free priority shipping.  It states that it'll take 7-10 business days for delivery, but mine only took 2 days. I was shocked! Of course it'll vary depending on your location. In total, I paid $8.79.  These condoms were voted #1 about 6 years in a row. The reviews on there are great and if anyone gave a low rating, it had to do either with size or the light lubrication. The former can't be helped; the latter is an easy fix. The pack sizes you can order from are 12, 24, 54, 102 and 252. Prices run from $6.99 (lowest) to $59.99 (highest), they also sell it in bulk. I searched for the best price before I purchased, even looked here, and I felt the price there was already pretty good, add the free shipping and the discount and my mine was made.Now as far as use goes, I thought the condom looked smaller than other condoms, but it slipped right on my sweetie with no problems. I used advice from one of the review's comments here on Amazon and put some lube in the condom beforehand. Now of course it depends on the size of your guy, but my guy is a decent size, and he said the fitting wasn't tight.  During love making, he kept praising the condom (and me of course, lol) and saying exactly what the reviews said, that it felt like he didn't have on anything. He was amazed! He lasted as long as he does using condoms but still felt all the sensations a guy would feel had we not used anything. I got these condoms for HIM, because I wanted us to be protected but I wanted him to be able to feel as much as possible. I also noticed that there was no latex and sex smell after we were done.Read more ›",5.0

300,B0047526G0,"Most people will see the thickness and be turned off but there is a trick to getting the most out of this condom. Try unrolling it a bit before putting it on. Yes it will look funny in an extra baggy way but this is important. The looseness at the end will make it so you can move inside some before the condom moves with you. This will create friction inside and friction is feeling. With a normal condom you have to rely on stretching to create this friction. The tapered end should hold securely onto the base (if your sized right), but I would test things out solo to make sure there are no surprises.",5.0

I generally need a larger condom and the comfort tip on these accommodate that nicely. They're thin enough that they're not restrictive and though they fit me a little more on the snug side I've been loyal to this brand/style for over ten years and I've yet to break one which is more than I can say for many of the others I've tried. They're offered here at a great value and if you're an average or larger man I'd recommend these!If you're on the smaller side, I'd recommend you try something different as I imagine these might be a struggle to keep on for smaller guys because of the combination of them being on the thinner side and the comfort tip.",5.0

329,B0070YFJKK,"Absolutely the best delay condoms out there. Zero pregnancy so far too so that is a plus! I still prefer the trojan bareskin but these are a nice way to switch it up every once in a while. They have not broken for me once, but I have never had a single condom ever break. I think if they are used properly condoms will not generally break unless there is a manufacturing defect. The ribs were very intense but after a few minutes they became very arousing for the girl. They did seem to delay male climax but nothing that caused complete numbness like some people report. Other people also have said that the lube on the inside is clumpy. This is because it is clumpy! It is made to become liquid when heat is transferred. If the inside was liquid lubricant, it would run on the outside and the female would get numb too! Numbness on the female side has not been an issue with me at all, and unless these are stored at temperatures around body temperature, then that should never be a problem. I would not shy away from trying these at all!",5.0

332,B0070YFJKK,"This product definitely does what it's supposed to do.  The real question is, ""Do you need it?""In my younger years I definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation.  Sex was great for me, but I doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes.  So I regularly used condoms like these, only a different brand.  Fortunately, I'm much older now, and much more experienced with sex, including how to control my body and not get too excited, too fast.  Unfortunately, I didn't consider that before purchasing these.  To say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case.  Between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic, I couldn't feel a thing.  I started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well, and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom.  Anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town.  Embarrassing to say the least, but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it (after I switched to a different condom and finished the job).For guys who get a little too excited, are inexperienced, or are just very sensitive, this is probably a great product.

Hormonal birth control works in that it kills my normally healthy sex drive so we often use condoms.My husband can't use regular condoms.  Period.  They are too tight and end up effecting his ability to stay ... well ... effective.  Girth is the issue here rather than the length.  The length of extra large magnums is apparently long enough for 9"".  We have tried the Trojan Magnum and although usable, they are still very constrictive.  So tight in fact that they nearly flatten the ridge of the head which I thought was generally to be expected with condoms.  Not a very enjoyable thing.  My husband hated even the Magnum size so next we tried Trojan Magnum XL and although still tight, they don't seem to effect his overall shape as much.  And as they are the biggest size we can find to be affordable for regular use, we don't have much of a choice.  Apparently, you can order custom fit condoms if you're rolling in the dough.I never had problem like that with past partners and was barely aware of the size of XL.  I finally broke down and researched enough to see if my husband was extra sensitive or extra large as the size indicates.  I learned that the girth size suggested for condoms according to www.condom-sizes.org are as follows:  (measure the girth at the midpoint of the erection):Regular:  girth < 5.3""Magnum:  5.3"" < girth < 5.5""XL:  5.5"" < girth < 5.8""out of luck: 5.8"" < girthMuch to my husband's annoyance, I forced a measurement and found him to have a 6.0"" circumference, average is somewhere around 4.8"".

Shame on them. European brands like ""MySize"", ""TheyFit"" and ""Pasante"" are built with similar quality standards as Trojan and they have much real larger sizes. The problem is that it is very difficult to get them.By the way, compare the Magnum Trojan XL packaging size with another brand.

I'll tell you my size to put it in perspective: I'm almost 7"" with above-average girth.  I'm kind of big.  The large condoms fit me fine.

For a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width, who can wear most regular U.S. condoms such as Durex that may be about 54mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring, these Sagami Original 002 were extremely difficult to put on (as or more difficult than the Okamoto 002 Regular) as this Sagami Original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on. Once on the shaft was ok, but the base ring of these Sagami 002 Original was very much way too tight (leaves an indentation) and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these Sagami Original were not comfortable to use, so unfortunately I threw out the rest of the box. I do not use a magnum, as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough, so these Sagami Original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring. The length of these Sagami Original 002 is about just over six inches in length. I would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring. I don't know if the Sagami 002 Large (maybe about 58mm width) would be too wide, and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack, then maybe I will try the Sagami 002 Large to see how those fit in width. I really like the Sagami containers for packaging and I would pay more for any condom in these great containers.

Can't rave enough about this, as it is _really_ the closest you'll get to not using one. You can tell that its on, but the sensitivity is so ridiculously increased compared to thicker condoms, that you won't mind it :)Use lube if you start to feel friction, difficulty thrusting or the like. Seriously. You can literally burn through the condom via friction without it. That these condoms are so thin, it can be difficult to tell that you've done so...If you run on the thicker or longer side, this isn't going to fit you. Others have said this, but I'm going to clarify: if you're over 2"" in girth this will be an uncomfortable stretch in the sense that it will be difficult to even get the condom on, and displace the tip's reservoir. I've read that these condoms are ~1.4"" girth, but up to 2"", you'll fit without major issue. Try the larges if there don't work out for you.",5.0

353,B00C33CVSQ,I really like these. I am a smaller girth so these work well. They are thin so there is more feel. They have never slipped of during intercourse however when you pull out after an unload make sure to hold it from the base to avoid if from slipping off.,5.0
354,B00C33CVSQ,"These are absolutely fantastic condoms.  It isn't the size that matters, it's how you use it - but you can't use it if you don't get a good fit with protection!  That's where LifeStyles ""Snugger fit"" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up ""averages"" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?  It infuriates me that they don't carry these in stores.  Not everybody has a porn star penis.  Get real.CON:  I didn't like that they arrived in a Ziploc bag.  That was weird.

As you can see from my profile, I'm just a typical consumer.*5 stars*: This rating means the item matches the item description and is a good value for the price listed at the time I reviewed it. I recommend it feeling confident that most people who read the description and take price into consideration will be pleased with it. If it exceeds my expectations and is an exceptional value, I put that in the heading.

361,B009729698,"The only reason I ever ordered these condoms was because my girlfriend has a latex allergy. I figured they'd be lame because A) condoms are annoying to begin with, and B) if good condoms could be made from something other than latex, than why is latex the de facto standard for like every condom in the universe?Well, I still don't know the answer to B), but after going through a box of Skyn condoms, I can honestly say that I would use them even if my partner weren't allergic to latex. They feel significantly better than the condoms I've used in the past (Trojans), and they're reliable. As a bonus, buying them here is vastly cheaper, more convenient, and less embarrassing than buying them at Walgreen's. I'd recommend this product to anyone who relies on condoms for birth control with a significant other, latex allergy or not.When I ordered a second box, the seller accidentally put the wrong item in the package. The packing slip showed the correct order, but instead of 50 Skyn condoms there were 50 Snugger Fit condoms, which are made from latex. I contacted the seller through Amazon, explained that the latex condoms were useless to me because of my girlfriend's latex allergy, and requested that the correct item be sent to me as soon as possible.My complaint was filed on Monday night. On Tuesday morning I had a response from the seller, who apologized for the error and said that the correct item was on its way. On Wednesday morning the correct condoms were on my doorstep via Fed Ex. Although I was pretty annoyed when I got the wrong item in the package, the seller's blistering fast customer service and immediate correction have left me with an even higher esteem for the folks who make these condoms.",5.0

Don't listen, Im 7 1/2 and close to two inches in diameter and these roll almost all the way down to the base and don't feel too tight. I don't get the ""plastic bag"" sensation with these.

Nonetheless, I hate condoms to the extent where just opening the wrapper made Senor Johnson go back to sleep almost instantaneously.But Senor Johnson approves of these.  They're so thin that you'd think they'd tear easily, but I've never had one of these fail in my life.  They're well lubed without leaving you sliding all over the place, and they don't have that noxious smell that gets progressively worse as bodily fluids get involved.  These are as inoffensive as condoms get.The only problem with them is that they're a bit tight, even by average standards.  For average Joes, that might be a good thing since it's absolutely impossible to slip out of these unless Senor Johnson passes out.  But if your Senor Johnson is pornstar tier, these might feel more like a mechanical vice than a condom.

Condoms are condoms anyway so as long as they do the job, I am ok with any brand -- except small ones, of course. I was hoping to get regular sized condoms and I think that's what I got. I said ""I think"" because I am familiar with all the brands that arrived but not the specific model/variety. I'll be talking more about the brands, too.First off, the condoms came in an (see photo) envelope-sized packaging with bubble wraps inside. So you do not have to worry about receiving a damaged item that may happen during shipping. I like that the package is discreet.Inside, the condoms were packed in another plastic bag that said 'Sold as set, do not separate.' And when opened comes the revelation of which brands were in my package. It felt fun, too. I felt like a kid opening a gift, eager to find out what's inside. I actually just got four varieties of condoms, but just two brands. The condom brands/names were: CautionWear Black Ice, CautionWear PPE, Beyond Seven (orange), Beyond Seven (green). I got six of each, which makes 24. Photos attached (unopened, of course). All styles are lubricated. I was quite pleased to see brands that I recognize and honestly like using and frequently buy: Beyond Seven is a good condom brand in my opinion so I am happy that I got them. Cautionwear is good, too, but I only know of IronGrip variety. I know these brands are unfamiliar to some, but I know my condoms and these brands are good. LOL.

These work well, I honestly don't feel much difference between types, my husband says the thinner the better. He has always liked the durex brand best so we stick with it. None have broken and overall, these are more affordable. Here's hoping they do their job and we don't have any surprises too soonWill reorder when we need more.Update: we have been really disappointed with the orange condoms. They are weird and uncomfortable. They made up half our box too.After using these for a while, I have really come to dislike the smell and consider the various chemicals used on them as a problem for me. I mean, I try to be chemical free in everything else, so after a little thought, I decided to opt for a latex condom without chemical lubricants and dyes and fragrance. You can buy these on Amazon too, they are called sustain condoms.

The Trojan ones were really too small and very tight and I don't think very well lubricated. I would absolutely recommend this product if you are trying out condoms, it's a lot cheaper than buying an entire box of something you may not like or doesn't fit well.

421,B00HRU9YDU,"Wow, these are some of the first condoms I've ever enjoyed and I've tried nearly all the alternative styles.  Perhaps because I'm also a little larger, so the comment that said it's a ""trash bag"" is more about sizing than anything else.  Great for bigger guys, there's room and it is tapered at the bottom so it stayed on great.",5.0
422,B00HRU9YDU,"My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.",5.0
423,B00HRU9YDU,"I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.Size:I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.Shape:They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.Lube:The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.",5.0
424,B00HRU9YDU,"If I could give it a -1 I would.  These things REEK to high Heaven, the ""ribbing"" is nothing more than a pencil line, and the shape matches NO male anatomy I've ever encountered.  Frigging' Yuck.",1.0
425,B00HRU9YDU,"These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.",2.0
426,B00HRU9YDU,"Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.",5.0

428,B00328R398,"I really like these Crown condoms because of their thinness (.04mm) and how well they fit. I would put these slightly above the Durex Extra Sensitive ultra thin condoms 24 pack (Pack of 2). These two condoms are my favorite but these Crown condoms are my #1 choice. And there must be a reason these Crown condoms are the #1 choice of pornstars when they have to use condoms.As for these Crown condoms I was a little cautious about using them at first since they are pretty thin and was worried about them breaking but I've had some pretty intense and rough sex with different women and these have yet to break on me. Also I'm not sure how hung some of the reviewers are complaining about these condoms not fitting but I'm bigger than average with good girth and they fit me really well. So unless you're Lex Steele these condoms are gonna be just fine for 99.9% of users. And for the lucky .1%, there are Magnums and other condoms of that ilk.My only gripe with these condoms is the way they arrive. All 50 condoms are loose and not packaged in a nice little box.P.S. I was lucky enough to win a gag gift basket at a friends bachelor party which included OKAMOTO CONDOMS ZERO ONE 0.01mm 3pcs MADE IN JAPAN - 3Boxes and MY GOD those condoms were AWESOME. It totally feels like you got nothing on. But these .01mm condoms are expensive. I'm sure Amazon has better deals than what these cost.",5.0
429,B00328R398,"Just to preface, I wasn't super thorough about all of this.I just so happen to have a batch of Crown condoms from years ago. I ordered them from Condom Depot on October 5, 2010. They expired June 2015, and are from batch number T170. December 14, 2015, I ordered the same condom from Amazon. They expire October 2019, and are from batch number T4Y4. I have no guarantee that the old batch was produced in Japan, but there is a slight chance. Condom Depot wrote an article (""Crown Condoms Thailand & Japan What’s The Deal?"") regarding the differences between manufacturing locations, dated March 11, 2009. In that article, they claimed to have bought 400,000 condoms from Japan before the transition was made. Now I would think there is a chance that I received some from Japan, but do keep in mind that it has been their best selling condom for 15 years in a row. So do you think they sold 400,000 condoms in more than 19 months? The odds probably fall in that direction. Anyway, let's see if this unnecessarily thorough review helps anyone!Sensation: The older batch seems to have a slight better sensation to it, but they're both so similar that it is extremely difficult to tell.Thickness: Placing the two, still rolled, side by side, the older batch seems to be ever so slightly thinner. This goes against the article from Condom Depot, as they state those manufactured in Japan are 0.005mm thicker than those made in Thailand. Curious about this, I tried measuring two others that were still in their packaging. Keep in mind that I have a crappy $15 digital caliper, but the old batch came to 3.31mm, and the new batch 3.46mm. I tried not to squish them, so I based my measurements off of how much drag I felt when removing the caliper after measuring.Read more ›",5.0
430,B00328R398,"Arrival was timely and fit is snug but not painful. Not planning a bedroom marathon with these so they're fine for now. They do feel more like bare skin than anything else tried, but the light lubrication didn't seem like it was there at all. In fact, it seemed like there wasn't any and with BC pills natural lube isn't always there. So, without the help of a lube bottle these can actually end up hurting both of us because of the dry rub. Still, they're liked and not a bad purchase for a small tester pack.",4.0
431,B00328R398,From a female perspective these are by far the greatest condoms out there. It feels almost like there's nothing at all between us. These are way better than the ultra thins on the market. We will never buy another brand.,5.0
432,B00328R398,"Well, in terms of protection, Crown skinless has always been my go-to brand and style. Next to that, Beyond Sevens, however most people vouch for Crown over Beyond Seven (both produced by the same company, however Crown is featured in many ahem, feature films...)The crown is comfortable, if a little snug for most men. It's also relatively thin, along the lines of .0042 thickness, if I recall correctly. You can get .002 and .002 thickness with other Japanese brands, however the price increases exponentially and the availability decreases as well. Crown is a wonderful go-between, but do be careful regarding the manufacturing locations.Many years ago I purchased them when they were the original silver and blue packaging. They were thin and barely felt like they were there. These new blue and white packets feel thicker to me for some reason, though it could be because I went for a period without the need for condoms, and now that things have changed, it's hard adapting back to the ole latex.I've used MANY of these condoms and have not had one failure. They are only lightly lubricated so make sure things are good to go before going at it or you'll create some heavy friction that's unpleasant for your partner (and bad for the latex). Very little smell on these, which is great, and the pink color almost makes it look invisible, which is another bonus.I am getting used to these, and have almost finished my current 50 pack. If you're a Durex or generic store-brand user, you owe it to yourself to give the Crowns a shot. They will literally blow your mind.",4.0

436,B0040VPJVK,"I refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised.  The packaging looks different even though they say its the same product (ultra thin line of trapan's).  also, even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom I got in a 3 pack from walmart a few weeks ago.  These are not made in the USA like the description says, they say made in Thailand on the back. The actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures, this nonsense they sent me is on the right.  I would not trust these, unless you're looking for baby mamma drama in about 9 months....",1.0
437,B0040VPJVK,"First of all, these are not real US Trojan condoms. They are a knockoff, made in Thailand. When my husband and I got married we bought the variety pack from Amazon, which has 5 different kind of condoms in them. He liked the ultra thin ones so I decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like $3-5 each. If you look at the photo where there's two condoms, the packaging is completely different. The one on the right side of the photo is the real, Trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in Thailand. So, not only is the packaging different, but they feel completely different as well. These Thailand ones are SO MUCH thinner, so 9 out of 10 break. Which, I've never had a real Trojan condom break. So, just a warning to all. THESE ARE FAKE. Unless you want a baby, do not purchase these.",1.0

They're safer than the regular sizes (won't slip off) and super nice on the wearer's ego (""snug fit"" sounds better than small).  It also makes a really thoughtful gift for the guy who has trouble finding his size or didn't even realize condoms came in a range of sizes - who doesn't appreciate a personalized gift?",5.0

449,B00C350E2Y,"This is just gonna be a short review, with photos attached.These are hands down my favorite condom.They are great in size (if you are above average.) They don't have any bad latex condom smell,  because of the material. They sometimes make me forget I'm even wearing one, because of how the fit.So I just ordered these and got them the other day.At first I wasn't sure whether to get them or not, because people say that they arrived in a plastic bag, and that they were not in the original box.After asking some people, I came to the conclusion, that I was gonna get them.I ordered them the 14th, and the estimated delivery time was between the 20th-25th.They were already shipped the 15th, and delivered to my place the 19th!!!First picture is what the envelope looked like, all the blurred boxes are just my personal info. It didn't say anything about condoms or whatever, for the people who prefer the discrete way.Second one you see the condoms, between 2 pieces of cardboard with a pretty decent thickness. To prevent any damages on shipping. Which I thought was brilliant.And let me not forget to say, that the envelope of course had bubble wrap too.Last one you see all the condoms lined up, they all come in pairs of 2, like they do when you buy them in their original box in a store.And then there was 1 extra one, that was just on its own, which I thought was a little weird? Why not just 24? Why not just 26?. But maybe they had some sort of idea with that, or just adding a little bonus..Ordering condoms online, I was definitely a bit naive. So I went ahead and checked each and every condoms for holes. And of course I didn't find any holes lol.I will definitely reply to any questions you may have, just to be nice to people in doubt, or wondering if these condoms are for them. Because I, was one of those people.",5.0

Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.  And since these aren't latex, they don't smell like a cross between Chilean sea bass and a latex glove when you are done waxing.  I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.  Trust me, these Jimmy's are a must if you like hitting skins and having the sensation you are raw dogging.

I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India.

453,B00C350E2Y,"I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.",4.0

If you're one of us that has been frustrated with slippage, BUY THESE!!! you might even find them too tight so I'd recommend getting the 12 count to make sure these are for you.  A lot of folks consider these the snuggest condoms on the market.  I also find the excess length of these on me acts as c-ring, which adds to my pleasure by prolonging climax.  For those of us on the short end of things, these are an awesome choice; good tight fit, lower price and peace of mind when used.

After taking the recommended dosage for the first 5 days I noticed that I not only had more energy, but I also noticed an increase of my sex drive. This has definitely shown me that it has the potential to change my life in a very positive way. I will continue to use it as long it gives me the results that it has so far. I would recommend this to anyone that has any issues with there sex drive or energy level.Update...It's been a few weeks now and I just purchased another bottle of this Tongkat Ali. I have found that shortly after running out of the first bottle I ordered, the extra energy and increased sex drive had began to wain. I don't know if my case is different then most people, but I dealt with a severe illness for the last 18 years of my life (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). For anyone not familiar with that illness...you basically feel like you have a severe case of the flu every day, which includes full body muscle aches and pain along with brain fog, poor sleep, non existent sex drive, no energy...and just an overall feeling of frustration.When I had first heard on the internet about Tongkat Ali being a natural way to improve not only my energy level, but also my sex drive and I just had to give it a try. It was recommended that you should only get the Indonesian form...and you should get at least 1:100 strength. After looking at all of the choices that Amazon had available I made the decision on this item based on the value and the reviews from people that had tried it. I'm so glad that I made the choice that I did. I was so surprised by the results I just have to get another bottle to keep that feeling going.

But i have to say that i feel this company cares for their customers, they have emailed me like 3 times already to find out how i feel about using this product. I haven't reply to any mail until now. I will definetely update any comment about this product in the future to let you know if it worked for me or not. I like to read reviews before buying any product.",5.0
469,B0088FLLK2,"I have been using for about a month.  I researched several key libido/ed herbs and supplements before purchasing.  I have taken normal and double dosages a week at a time - 5 days on 2 days offWhen I doubled up on this product, I noticed an aggressiveness from it.  So it does increase testosterone.  I went back to standard dosage and the aggressiveness went away.  Double dose too much for me.  I am 61, so a little help is good for the libido!Yes, after extensive reading and being a guinea pig, this product does work. I have ordered multiple times while the price is right!I am loving the fact that I am starting to wake up during the night with ""wood"" in my shorts!  Feels good, and it was missing. I am also noticing the women (in a sexual way) around me more in my daily activities. I am more alert and sleep better, so it has to have increased my testosterone levels.It may not work for everyone, but it works for me.  All I can say is try it for at least a month.  I noticed results in two weeks and a slow gradual increase in my feeling of well-being.",4.0

These have ribs that are just right and make it a million times more pleasurable. I don't like a smooth in and out, I like ribs that make it so there's just enough texture to make it more pleasurable but not painful. These are my favorite and I use them all the time except for when my boyfriend is close before we even start. When that happens the Trojan Extended work really, really well. If you want more pleasure and alittle more texture, these are definitely for you.",5.0

488,B0040W5URC,"After years of not using condoms because my wife was on birth control. I thought that the thinner the condom was, the better it would make me feel. I'm a little above average in size. About 6.5-7in. So we tried a whole lot of them. And I found out that I needed ones like these, with lubricant on the inside and outside. And the extra space around the shaft creates the closest feeling to not using one at all. And my wife feels the same way about them. This became our favorite condom line from the very first use!",5.0
489,B0040W5URC,I see some comments saying that the condom is too baggy but it fits me just fine. Just like shoes you have to find the ones that fit you best. The new style Trojan is doing does feel more comfortable than the traditional condom.,5.0
490,B0040W5URC,"A somewhat larger condom that feels good (for a condom), and the lady finds it comfortable.The silicone (?) lubricant seems to work well.  There's a noticeable latex-y smell. It allows for some movement inside the latex (a feature, according to the product description), which might feel a little strange if you're coming from the more tightly fitted Trojan ""Ultra Thin"" series.  Both this ""Her Pleasure"" and the ""Ultra Thin"" are better quality and more comfortable for the lady than the cheaper Durex brand we've also tried.For when you need to cover up, these are a good choice.",5.0

502,B00DZNLAI0,My husband and I love using this. The product is amazing. I must say personally I couldn't have asked for better. I don't have any allergies and there is no junk stuffed in these condoms. I have tried so many and wasted so much money. The great thing is I bought from a seller on here and they were selling it less than the official website and shipping was more affordable too! It worked out quite nicely buying from Amazon! The pleasure dots are just for me and my man doesn't mind one bit. The dots are a nice extra special treat for me. I love them!,5.0
503,B00DZNLAI0,"This is an excellent product with an excellent commitment to giving back. Women love feeling high-class using an extravagant, yet elegant new condom. I absolutely love the feel of Sir Richards pleasure dots. Thin enough to maximize pleasure, while not being thin to the point of worrying about them breaking. 10/10 will buy again.",5.0
504,B00BI0BGL8,LOVE these. Normally we buy them in Durex's Pleasure Pack because we can't find them separately in stores. The flavored condoms in that pack particularly suck because they run extra small and tight. So it was a waste of money basically. But super glad that we found these on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product is perfect quality. Box came a little dented but everything was fine. AND THAT PRICE. What a deal. We will definitely be buying these again. Thank you!,5.0

However, he said that these felt much tighter than the previous ones we had used from the same brand. In fact, there was a visible constriction of his penis around the base of the condom. I was surprised given the excellent track record we have with Durex, but at least none of them broke.",3.0

515,B007O3CPVS,"When Durex first came out with these condoms they were manufactured under the name Colors & Scents. They first appeared in the Pleasure Pack and were such a hit, they were then manufactured by themselves as Durex Tropical. These condoms are great for their purpose. The smell and taste of latex is horrible,If you love oral and like to switch things up a lot or perhaps sometimes are not able to finish with intercourse and then like to follow up with oral...this is perfect for you. There is no lingering taste or smell of latex to turn you off. This goes for guys or gals. It will make your penis or vagina smell and taste like whichever flavor you used during intercourse.These condoms come in three different flavors and sometimes four if you can find the rare fourth flavor of mint. The most common are strawberry, orange, and banana. These are also colored accordingly as red, orange, and yellow. My favorite is the strawberry. I think this has the best taste and flavor. Orange is next and then banana. This is a personal preference though. The mint green ones are great also.In terms of fit, this is how Durex Tropical compared to other condoms: Average condoms have a thickness of 0.0027"". This condom has a thickness of 0.00247"" which makes it a little thinner than most condoms. This will enhance sensitivity a bit.The average condom is 7.5"" long. This condom is also 7.5"". Because of the reservoir tip being small, this is why I recommend not using it on a penis longer than 7"". There needs to be wiggle and ejaculation room.Average shaft width and base width for condoms is 2"". This condom is smaller at 1.75"". This doesn't accommodate the guys on the thicker side. Keep size in mind. It works better for those with less girth.Read more ›",4.0

520,B00HI35HLY,Yes I do have mixed pleasures about these.  Overall they do what they're supposed to.  Which is cover and catch.  Good job team.  They fit a little small which is both good and bad.  The sensitive ones suddenly become super sensitive.  My favorite actually turned out to be the glow in the dark one.  And yes it does work.  open it up first let it collect a little room light while you give your lady a little moonlight. wink wink.  Then strap on.  The small fit does some...lets say extending of time.  And the glow in the dark is actually a little thicker so not quite as sensitive.  All in you will get more bang for your buck...wink wink...nudge nudge...wink wink.,5.0
521,B00HI35HLY,"Unique selection. Fun so far. My wife loves the funny unique wrappers. The pocket tin is definitely nice and convenient. I will update to let you know our favorites and why.Also in regards to the size issues others have had the issue not the length but girth. Length goes to 8 inches but girth is average to small. Which I like it snug it seems to feel better for both of us. And most people don't know this but a lose condom creates friction which in turn will break. And in case you wonder the ""Legend"" one that comes in the pack is slightly bigger than durex or regular Trojan's.",5.0

531,B0183LNHF2,I was excited as soon as I saw the commercial for these condoms and bought them same day. The first one worked fine but neither my partner nor I could tell any difference between these and the classic ribbed.But it went down hill from there the other two times we attempted to use these condoms the friction started to burn so bad we stopped having sex.

554,B00BWMOOD4,"My husband and I use condoms as our main form of Birth Control.  We have gone through many different brands, always searching for the kind we like the best.  What I can tell you from a female perspective is this... Almost every condom we have used has made my husbands... Mr. Happy (yeah, let's just call it that) feel like an adult toy.  Ladies, you know what I mean, that hard, foriegn feeling sex toy and not the velvet covered steel described in our romance novels.  My husband recently bought a multi pack of condoms that featured this specific brand and they happened to be the first one we tried.  I have to say... this one was a game changer for us!  It felt more... just MORE!  It felt like it was really my husband and not some fake substitute!  Every other one we've used has really constrained him and from what he says, they were all too tight.  After we had used this, we both went for a smoke and ended up talking about how much we liked this one.  We've never really done that before, so that should say a lot about the impression this made on us.  We have actually had several conversations since about how this is now our brand.  What he says to me is this:  The overall feel has been the closest to au natural that he's ever felt.  It has given the most freedom of sensation.  I very much agree.  I have seen a few people comment in their reviews about  the smell.  So, I feel I should address this.  I have never used a condom before without a smell, unless it was purposefully scented to mask it.  It is not any worse, nor better than any other we have tried.  I have also seen some people saying these were too large as well... All I can say to that is that you really need to know your size, as obviously to my husband and I we had been using ones that were to small.  Overall, We are very pleased with this and have settled on these as being our favorite.  They are pre-lubricated which are always a help, and though they are ribbed too, I can't really say I noticed a difference there.",5.0
555,B00BWMOOD4,"I originally used a variety pack of Trojans and Skins to figure out which kind I liked. These were a pretty obvious winner for both me and my girlfriend.Size:I feel that they are a bit larger in circumference than several of the others I tried, so they are probably best if you are a bit above average in girth. I would think if you are about the girth of a toilet paper roll these will fit you fairly comfortably.Shape:They seem to be a bit mushroomy in shape; a bit larger at the top, while a bit tighter at the base to keep the condom in place more. I found this to be more comfortable than a standard cylinder condom, but I am sure this is a personal preference. I guess it is possible that the narrower base helps you keep a more firm erection, but I wouldn't count on that.Lube:The condom has lube both on the inside and the out. I have a hard time telling the exact effect of it. It did seem that my girlfriend and I both reliably orgasmed while using these condoms so I suspect it did its job fairly well. I did not notice a particularly strong smell and do not know about taste.",5.0

557,B00BWMOOD4,"These smelled very strong and unappealing. They are Much wider than other condoms. They are alright for using as protection, however I would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width (wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person). No complaints from a women's perspective besides the smell.  From a mans perspective these are a big NO. 2 stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good.",2.0
558,B00BWMOOD4,"Purchased the ultrasmooth. Not sure what people think they're getting with this product, make sure you look at the diagram on the back of the box. I do not like using normal condoms that put you into a funnel shape and then potentially cause pain as space in the front has to forcibly be created. These cause no suffocation and provide plenty of room to release. However, the fit isn't going to be as tight so you do have to be more conscious of avoiding any spillage/slipping off. The smell and leftover feel is gross, but they're lubricated condoms. Also, it should be noted that it feels different for the woman, and she may not like the feel of the extra latex.",5.0
559,B015RN57VQ,"My wife and I both really enjoyed this condom -- it is SO impossibly thin! And it's magical how little it smells of latex. My wife and I tried this condom while we went on vacation, and we were very pleasantly surprised -- it's very comfortable for me, and when she goes down on me after sex, she likes it because I don't smell like latex. We didn't have a single breakage with over 20 used, and our longest use was about an hour and a half or so.I was seriously doubtful of this brand before (hadn't heard of it, was 'natural'), but I can't sing its praises enough. It does run a little bit smaller than other brands, but just enough that I noticed it and not so much felt uncomfortable. If you go on their website, they also have trial sizes for sale so you can find your size before you buy.",5.0

At first, I was hesitant to buy them since it costs so little for so many(for some reason I felt like a higher price point meant higher protection, feel, etc.)I just gave them a go and was very impressed. Very comfortable, snug fit. Incredibly thin yet very strong and elastic. When paired with a nice lube like Sylk, it's perfect.My girlfriend says they did not hurt like other brands.Thanks Chubby Dick Emporium!(Seriously, try them out.

Thin but strong.  Easy to use.  Fit comfortably.  A lot of people think they provide the best sensation on the market.  In that context, I would rate them way higher than anything made by Trojan, Lifestyles and other better-known manufacturers.

592,B0029XFWPE,"After nearly a decade of using Okamoto Crown condoms exclusively, my husband and I are sad to say that we're going to have to find another brand.  Ordinarily, and regardless of whether or not they were manufactured in Thailand, these condoms had almost no discernible odor and didn't cause any irritation for either one of us.The condoms in the last pack we purchased smelled like a pile of burning tires.  Not only that, but they also caused quite a bit of swelling and irritation.  The lot number and expiration date were E15/T3Z4 and 11/2019, respectively.  The only reason I'm divulging this particular information is because I'd be very curious to know whether or not others have noticed this change or we simply got a bad batch.Either way, we have to begin the search for a new brand of condom, preferably one that doesn't smell like burning rubber or cause the sort of irritation these now cause.",1.0

I'm just warning any of you who have read great reviews on these, because the ones made in Japan are actually really great. These Thailand condoms are cheap and stinky.To be fair, the fit seems to be roughly the same (feels a bit tighter) and my girlfriend and I used one when we ran out of good condoms (durex super thin extra sensitive condoms) and it wasn't awful minus the really disgusting smell (major turn off). The point is you don't want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else (or none at all!)Definitely go with the Durex extra sensitive on this one.

It definitely weirded me out at first. When I thought about it I realized of course if you're buying them in bulk they'll arrive that way, it just startled me when I first saw it.

At this rate they'll last forever. Maybe I'll just try them on for fun. Oh - I could learn how to tie balloon animals.",5.0
596,B0029XFWPE,The condom is true to its name. Really feels like nothing is there. Also they are very inexpensive (100pk for 15 dollars) one thing to remember is that as stated on the label it is lightly lubricated. So it's best to apply some extra especially if you plan on going for more then 10 mins. Another thing if you have more girth or length then average you will realize that it can be a snug condom. I personally felt like it didn't roll down close enough to my base a problem I haven't had with any other condom,4.0

626,B0009AHF1S,"Durex extra sensitive condoms are undoubtedly one of the most popular condoms in the World. There is no way one can go wrong with these condoms. They have been credited as being super thin which enhances balminess while at the same time performing their duty of protection.  Users of these condoms have reported that the condoms feel so natural they forget that they are wearing them. Regular condoms on the other hand have been discredited as being too thick which decreases the sensation because of the friction that results from thickness and the risk of bursting is high with the regular condoms.Sex is a pleasurable moment and when a condom insinuates otherwise then there is a problem. Foregoing the use of a condom (when it is required) because it fails to serve its purpose is a risky affair. One cannot be fully assured of being protected from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. And since there are no spare bodies that act as replacement and with stakes so high, health and wellness comes first. The guys at Durex have invested heavily on Research and Development to ensure that their products are top notch in the pleasure and protection category. The soft and silky materials that makes these condoms are fine tuned to ensure that they replicate the human skin which is why users wearing it forget they are wearing it. The silk is also responsible for that sexual sensation.With such an impressive track record and good reputation, Durex extra sensitive condoms are one of the safest condoms out there. Any company that takes Research and Development into account is not only in the business for money. It actually means that they strive for excellence and distinction in providing its customers with the best of the best.Read more ›",5.0

The 001 sagami are the best, but they cost (at the time of writing) literally like, $3-6 each. And I'm not that rich.And for those wondering, Japanese ""large"" is pretty much American regular. I made the mistake of ordering the Japanese regular and they didn't work very well.As they say, you pick two out of three. With condoms it's ""cheap, feels good , durability.""C + F = Typical thin cheap comdoms. These usually are just the same material as regular condoms and will break easier.C + D = Typical condoms. Wont break easily, but also wont feel very good because of how thick they are.F + D = Sagami 001 or 002. They use special processes and materials that raise the price, but what you get is better feel and durability.Cheap + Feel = Thin and will break easily.Quality + Cheap = Thick and feel terrible.FYI If you live near a Japanese supermarket they usually have these on sale.

In fact if these “ large ” condoms were any smaller they would not fit. So if you normally wear large in regular condoms these will not fit you. While these condoms are not the cheapest they are the best we have ever used.One thing you do have to keep in mind is that these are not latex so they do not stretch a lot. Don’t worry I have been using these for years and they have never ripped. On the plus side if you are allergic to latex these condoms are a bonus.Do yourself a favor and pick these condoms up.

These are awesome. They don't look like a normal condom and go on like some sort of hermetic seal. The thin-ness is ASTOUNDING and the feel is perfect. BUT... They're just not as big as a Magnum, which is what fits me best. If these are a ""Sagami Large,"" then PLEASE SAGAMI MAKE AN XL!!!!

May even be daring and try for .01's, but that's pushing it pretty far.Size L is actually just regular size, it's comparable to crown size, but because it's not latex, it's less stretchable. However, it held up quite nicely, had no smell (and very little lube). The packaging it comes in is very chic, and each condom come wrapped in a nice plastic container, similar to daily disposable contacts. These are definitely premium condoms and look the part.

Trojan Supra are made of polyurethane also but they're at 0.04mm thick, rather go latex, fits better.

They don't have any bad latex condom smell,  because of the material. They sometimes make me forget I'm even wearing one, because of how the fit.So I just ordered these and got them the other day.At first I wasn't sure whether to get them or not, because people say that they arrived in a plastic bag, and that they were not in the original box.After asking some people, I came to the conclusion, that I was gonna get them.I ordered them the 14th, and the estimated delivery time was between the 20th-25th.They were already shipped the 15th, and delivered to my place the 19th!!!First picture is what the envelope looked like, all the blurred boxes are just my personal info. It didn't say anything about condoms or whatever, for the people who prefer the discrete way.Second one you see the condoms, between 2 pieces of cardboard with a pretty decent thickness. To prevent any damages on shipping. Which I thought was brilliant.And let me not forget to say, that the envelope of course had bubble wrap too.Last one you see all the condoms lined up, they all come in pairs of 2, like they do when you buy them in their original box in a store.And then there was 1 extra one, that was just on its own, which I thought was a little weird? Why not just 24? Why not just 26?. But maybe they had some sort of idea with that, or just adding a little bonus..Ordering condoms online, I was definitely a bit naive. So I went ahead and checked each and every condoms for holes. And of course I didn't find any holes lol.I will definitely reply to any questions you may have, just to be nice to people in doubt, or wondering if these condoms are for them.

Last night I had to check 3 times to make sure my condom hadn't slipped off, that's how good it felt.

I usually tie the open end in a knot and flush them down the toilet right before I hit the gas pedal and head home.

I bought another 25 pack, this time from a different seller. The first time they arrived in the mail, they arrived in regular condom boxes of 3. This second time, they arrived loosely without boxes in one of those bubble lined envelope things. I thought it odd, but then thought because I ordered from a different seller. Any who, I picked them up today, used one, and noticed I had unusual leftover space. I did my thing, finished, and when i pulled out, I definitely knew these weren't the same ones i received the first time. The first batch i received fit like a glove; these fit like a loose sock. Luckily, I had one left over from the first batch and compared wrappings. Definitely not the same ones. I want to know if I received counterfeit ones, or if this is what they look and fit like now.In the pictures, the left condom is the one I received the first time, which I loved. The right condom is the new batch I received. Obvious packaging differences. In the front image, you can see the ""S"" emblem is bigger on the left one than the right one.  One also says ""TM"" and the other ""R"". On the back image, The writing on the left looks neat and legible. On the right, it looks a mess. Left was manufactured in Thailand, the right in India.

675,B01FEHW0B0,"I began researching non-latex condoms because I learned that my girlfriends don't have painful burning in the shower after sex like I do. I knew I was STD free, so I just thought that was a natural reaction to the friction of sex, broken skin and sensitivity that can be consistent and persistent if you have a libido like mine. Once I began to use these the pain was completely gone! I've been using these for years now, and so have used them with several partners at this point. One of my partners found it very difficult to orgasm with these ""plastic condoms"" as he used to call them. We had been together for years, and he is the one I transitioned to these condoms with, so I know that the condom change was the source of the problem for him. With my partners since him I never used anything but these, and they thought the sex was great and had no problems. We never discussed the condoms aside from, ""this is the kind you have to use,"" so I can't offer much more insight regarding the man' experience. Even if we did talk about it, I don't think they could really know if it was better or worse with these condoms, since it's the only kind they used with me and so they couldn't compare the experience with this condom with what it would be like with a latex one.",4.0
676,B00IMUGVEY,"These are hands down the holy grail of condoms. I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them.

This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.

680,B00IMUGVEY,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms.

I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
683,B00IMUGVEY,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0

With certain brands I have to use half a gallon of lube just to keep things moist before it goes dry due to the condom, but I haven't had that problem with these.That was one of the biggest differences -- the sensation and the fact that at times it didn't feel like I was wearing anything at all.

Let me tell you why.My girl is sensitive to the latex(esp. trojans) so I have stopped using that brand for a while although the bare skin one was okay.Even though this condom is latex, it was odd that my girlfriend didn't even react to it. She's very sensitive to latex and it irritates her VJ while making it dry but this one didn't even get to that problem.I certainly enjoy using this condom due to many reasons.PRO- It is very thin!!! It is not as thin is Sagami .01mm but thin enough to feel the heat transfer from my girlfriend's VJ- Nicely lubed compared to Skyn and few other brands- It feels like doing raw a bit but ofc, RAW is always the best with the partner you trust.- Fits nicely, little on the tight side but I don't mind it- My girlfriend doesn't react to this latex condom at all!!!- There are thinner condoms out there but this beats their price(vs. Sagami)- Durability is outstandingCON- Can be thinner(sorry for being too greedy) I would like it SUPER THIN if it can be put into production- I seem to be ejaculating a little faster compared to other condoms(also maybe b/c my girl is squeezing more since she feels it more)Nothing really for CON.

693,B0040XYBDK,"Yup, they're condoms.  If you're unsure about whether you like these specifically I'd suggest you order a smaller pack of them first.  If you don't already know, Magnum is known for making larger condoms than most other brands, being most well known for their XL condoms (which these are not).  It took me a number of years of trying different types and styles of condoms to realize that I kept having trouble with them breaking or slipping because they weren't fitting correctly (mostly too small).  I would encourage anyone that feels like other condoms are too tight to at least give these a try.  Don't try to ""size up"" your condoms and use a type that's too big for you.  Unlike other styles and brands, these don't have the built-in cock ring style where the lip of the opening is slightly smaller than the rest of the condom that theoretically keeps a condom that's a little too big for you from slipping off.  It similarly avoids the problem of those same condoms that have a tendency to tear if you're not actually the proper size because the sheath of the condom is sliding around rather than staying static on your penis.  The lubricant does not have a slight numbing effect like spermicidal lubricants of other condoms, but it is slightly lubricated.  I wouldn't count on the lubrication as it's more of a slightly oily-feeling latex than a fully lubricated condom.",5.0

698,B00IMUGVE4,"These are hands down the holy grail of condoms. I've been a long time user of Naturalamb condoms and always loved the sensations from them but those are weird, smelly condoms. My new girlfriend developed an allergy to the Naturalamb condoms so I set out for something new and disovered the .002 condoms from Okamoto. The Okamoto's are definitely better than traditional American condoms but still had that latex condom feeling.So then I ordered these, not expecting much more. Wow. My girlfriend immediately commented that it felt totally bare and I agreed. We went through the entire 5-pack in just a few days. I am of average to slightly above average size and they fit like a glove - but not too tight - and stay on securely. I check to make sure it's still on right before I finish since it's impossible to tell if it's on and it's been there every time. Everything from the packaging to the look and feel of these condoms are classy an expensive. If you can afford it go for them. It gets expensive if you have a girlfriend and use them regularly, but if you are single guy and only need them a few times a month then the price is well worth it considering how much you are spending on dating and going out.",5.0
699,B00IMUGVE4,"Perfect. I could even feel the V-temperature inside when I... lol you know.I'm sure if I add a photo, I will lose my amazon account haha :p",5.0
700,B00IMUGVE4,"It's pretty amazing how thin they are, yet can still do the job.  And it's *almost* like you're not wearing anything, but there's no doubt that you are.  But still, it's the most sensation you can reasonably expect to feel, while wearing protection.  Then why am I rating them 4 stars, instead of 5?  Two reasons.  One: the high price.  Two: they are easily torn when putting them on.  You really have to be careful in the heat of the moment to not poke a hole in it (and waste a condom).",4.0
701,B00IMUGVE4,"I was so excited about these I bought several packs.  My junk is like ""get that thing away from me"" at the site of a condom.  Excitement turns to...oh god.  So I bought these thinking ""thinnest condoms in the world"" great!I went to put it on...wow..non-latex condoms sure are hard to unroll.  Meanwhile I'm totally losing my erection.  This is ridiculous I thought to myself.  I also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing.  But you know how some reviewers are.Once I got this thing unrolled, LMAO!  Listen, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I got some super sized, I consider myself average size ....  but these things were so tight, I don't even think I could get fully erect as I felt like my frickin' circulation was being cut off down there.  In fact it was so tight and uncomfortable I looked down only to see more poor ... being strangled by this condom.  Not trying to be funny, if you have a small erect penis, you're in luck these will likely work for you.  If you're average or above average, fageddaboutit.I couldn't do it.  I could no longer stay up with this thing on.  So I tossed it and reverted to the tried and true Trojan Bareskin.  Only because I had a few lying around.I'm going back to the best condoms ever.  Crown!  Those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you're going to get.  And trust me...I've been researching this for years!I was extremely disappointed to spend as much as I did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like.  Clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it's circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the 0.01 thinness of this condom.",2.0
702,B00IMUGVE4,"First off, I must confess that I have never had intercouse without a condom in my life. Therefore, I am unable to gauge if using these condoms are the closest thing to having sex bareback. However, I have used my fair share of latex & polyurethane condoms to which I prefer polyurethane over latex, & out of every condom I used this was by far the most sensitive I ever encountered. The first time I used this condom I immediately noticed a difference in sensation. My exact words upon insertion was "" Oh S***....Damn."" These condoms are pricey but if you are looking for sensitivity, it's worth it. The only drawback about these condoms are that they are short & don't roll all the way down to the base the way a condom should. These condoms seem durable though despite being the thinnest condoms on the market, & have reliably  withstood the motion in the ocean never busting on me which is typical of polyurethane condoms. I would highly recommend these condoms. They're the best I have ever used.",5.0
703,B00IMUGVE4,Truly the best condom I have ever used. It's amazing how thin they have managed to make this condom. I love it.,5.0
704,B00IMUGVE4,"I've tried all of durex condoms,  Okamoto crown,  Okamoto 0.002, and Trojan ultrathin but none of them can compare to this holy grail of a condom. It doesn't feel like nothings there but comes damn close.  I was surprised when I first tried these because it turned me into a one minute man.  I am so glad I found these.  I can stay safe and not feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.  Win-win.",5.0
705,B00IMUGVE4,I hate wearing condoms. My ex girlfriends and I use to get into arguments over the topic many many times. So when I heard these came out I was a bit skeptical. I previously tried Trojan's Naturalamb. Which at the time was the best option available. But upon recieving these Sagami 001's I immediately knew it was going to be better. This thing feels thinner than saran wrap  you actually feel it might break because its so thin. Almost like if someone sprayed a thin flim of polyurethane on your junk.On to the testing! The biggest challenge is if you can get a nut off using a toy like a fleshlight or something. Which I successfully did. That is a IMPOSSIBLE task usually when wearing a condom (Makes clean up a lot easier) and I was very surprised at how great they felt. Next I tried to break the condom by pulling it down and around and they help up just like any other condom.My only criticism is that sometimes the head area can bundle up. So it is suggested to put a little drop of water based lube on the head area to help with comfort. (Not on the whole shaft or this thing will slide further and futher down) but this tip goes for all condoms.Final thought: I still prefer going natural but I recommend to any of you gents to buy a box and see for yourself. I am very excited condom technology has got this far. I hope a decade from now it will improve even more to make sex feel just like going raw but protected at the same time. And I think the Japs will be the ones to invent that.,5.0
706,B00IAT4LNA,"No joke, great condoms.  I have tried the Durex, Lifestyles and many many other brands of rubbers over the last 16 yrs or so.  These are very good, and will feel like your condom broke, but they never do.... super strong.ProGreat feeling,Super tight fit, so no accidental pull offFits all sizes, I am on the very large girth size and use large condoms because of this, but these even in regular are super tight, and add to the don't feel like I'm using them feeling,No smellHeat transfer.... you will feel all the heat and sensation you lose with latex.Cons:Need lube for these, seem to be without lube, even though they are lubed, if issue get lube or use the extra lube ones.Can be tough to put on, take your time and because they are rolled so tight, make sure you check to see if its rolled under its self this will cause it to stop rolling down, just roll up a little and back down, or use lube before you start rolling.Super tight can because of this can cause 1. super sensitivity and will make you finish faster, 2. must pinch tip, because condom will not move during sex, and this can cause issues when finishing up.Over all one of my favorites in condoms.  Love how they feel, love the fact that they don't move during sex, and use these over latex anytime.  This and the fact that they are SUPER strong,and if you have allergies these are a MUST in any brand.",4.0
707,B00IAT4LNA,"If they fit for you, they're the best non-latex condom you can get.  Polyurethane doesn't have much stretch so they're going to feel a bit tighter; that said, the feeling is a lot better.  I'd say if your member is on the low range of the suggested size for a Trojan magnum, then that's the maximum size then these will fit for you comfortably.The good: It's probably the closest to not wearing a condom feel you can get.  This was an issue the first few times I used them because I thought it slipped off.  I've never had an issue with slippage though.  Heat transfer is great.  It's thin so you'll feel a lot more.The bad: They don't roll incredibly easy compared to other condoms.  Practice with one before the first time you're with your partner to save some embarrassment.  I also wish there was a better reservoir tip; breakage hasn't been an issue but a better tip would be nice.  They are tight due to being polyurethane; it's really a personal preference if they're too tight for you.If you're in the market for a non-latex condom your two best options are these and Lifestyles Skyn.  I recommend trying both to see which work better for you.",5.0
708,B00IAT4LNA,"I have interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and vulvar vestibulitis, all of which make me very sensitive to condoms and lubricants. While I do not have a latex allergy, I find that latex condoms irritate my conditions. Additionally, I typically can't tolerate the lubricants that come on condoms, but I could not find a non-latex, non-lubricated condom. After doing some research, I discovered that polyurethane condoms are superior to polyisoprene because they can conduct temperature better and are thinner. I decided to give these a try despite the lubricant and found that I tolerate them very well. My partner and I both agree that they feel closer to ""bare back"" sex than any other condom and I don't have to deal with pain, burning, and UTI's afterward. Also, I can use non-water based lubricants that I find more effective and gentle and not worry about compromising the integrity of the condom. We won't use any other condom now.",5.0
709,B00IAT4LNA,"yay! no kids yet!Aside from that this is as good as it gets.  I've tried many brands and types, this is the one for me.  It's more expensive than latex but it also feels WAY better and doesn't have that horrid latex smell.  There is no smell that comes from using these.",5.0
710,B00IAT4LNA,"im allergic to latex so finding a decent priced condoms are sometimes hard to come around. these are decently priced and they actually feel nice when using them.

Anyway, good price and product, prompt delivery and good communication.",5.0
713,B00IAT4LNA,"Having an allergy to latex, I have found these to be one of the better non-latex condoms.  I was a little leery buying these as some of the other reviews were not all that favorable.They are a little more snug, but I personally like that in a condom.",5.0
714,B00C8HLJ4O,I really like these. I am a smaller girth so these work well. They are thin so there is more feel. They have never slipped of during intercourse however when you pull out after an unload make sure to hold it from the base to avoid if from slipping off.,5.0
715,B00C8HLJ4O,"These are absolutely fantastic condoms.  It isn't the size that matters, it's how you use it - but you can't use it if you don't get a good fit with protection!  That's where LifeStyles ""Snugger fit"" come in handy.  They have no smell, have just the right amount of lubricant and the actual density of the condom is pretty thick, IMHO... but I'm not a man, I'm not sure what is average or what isn't.  I love how they fit him like a glove and not a bag.  These are specifically designed for a modestly sized penis - not bringing up ""averages"" as I call it a load of pooh, because again, it's how you use it.  But if you are girthy, these are not for you.  They will be way too small.  These allow for peace of mind, comfort and who doesn't love purple?  It infuriates me that they don't carry these in stores.  Not everybody has a porn star penis.  Get real.CON:  I didn't like that they arrived in a Ziploc bag.  That was weird.

There is a reason why so much effort has been spent by many companies trying to make condoms as thin as possible, it is hard to describe but you will feel it when you try it.Would buy again.",5.0
731,B00WR9E6YS,"Although technically thinner than the Sagami Original 002, I find the Aoni 001 to be inferior in terms of sensation. The Sagami felt a lot better for me.Additionally, I find the Sagami to be of better production quality in several ways:1) The Aoni's lubricant isn't very evenly applied. The head portion is too wet while the base portion is often entirely dry. The Sagami has very even application of lube.2) The thickness of the Aoni seems to be uneven - the head is probably thin enough to be 001 (is it 0012 technically?), but the material seems to increase in thickness toward the base (or so it feels). The Sagami on the other hand is very uniform in thickness and provides very good sensitivity over the entire length.",3.0
732,B00WR9E6YS,"i did receive this product at a discount for my honest review.i dont really know what condoms should cost. my girlfriend and i have been together for years and no longer use them on a regular basis (we trust her pill). but these seem to be a bit pricey. though, they do fill better then cheaper/regular  condoms.there was a short time frame where she was off the pill and we had to start using them again. i was in search of the best feeling (as if nothing was there).i never tried the lamb skin, since they cost too much.but i ended up liking the trojan ultra thin. these are very similar to those. a regular condom is thicker but with a more elastic rubber.these and Trojan ultra thins are thinner, but the rubber is more stiff (almost feels like a plastic blend). when you first put it on you feel the difference. a regular condom would balloon if you filled it with water, where these would keep 90% their shape.they may feel a bit tight at first, but as they warm up they start to feel as they arent there. i would put these at just under the trojans (as far as comfort and feel), but very close. i would probably go with whatever was cheaper if i was looking to buy again.",4.0
733,B00WR9E6YS,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the smell of these things!  What a total mood killer.  I asked my wife to describe the smell for this review and ""cheap floral perfume"" pretty much sums it up.  They smell like a discount store air freshener to me.  I guarantee the moment you pop one of these open, the discussion is going to be ""what is that smell?""  And then it gets on your hands.  And from there, everywhere else.  Don't use these with an unfamiliar partner, or you run a serious risk of them forever associating you with this horrible smell.",1.0

It's nice they are color coded for which side is which too! This makes it allot easier and less of a time waster to put on.We'd say they feel a lot better!
