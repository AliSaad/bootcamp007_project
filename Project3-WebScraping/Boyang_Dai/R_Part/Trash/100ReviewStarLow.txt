"1" "i refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised the packaging looks different even though they say its the same product ultra thin line of trapan s also even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom i got in a pack from walmart a few weeks ago these are not made in the usa like the description says they say made in thailand on the back the actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures this nonsense they sent me is on the right i would not trust these unless you re looking for baby mamma drama in about months" "negative"
"2" "first of all these are not real us trojan condoms they are a knockoff made in thailand when my husband and i got married we bought the variety pack from amazon which has different kind of condoms in them he liked the ultra thin ones so i decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like each if you look at the photo where there s two condoms the packaging is completely different the one on the right side of the photo is the real trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in thailand so not only is the packaging different but they feel completely different as well these thailand ones are so much thinner so out of break which i ve never had a real trojan condom break so just a warning to all these are fake unless you want a baby do not purchase these" "negative"
"3" "do not buy these are thai knock off condoms and not genuine trojans they are not made in the usa they are made in thailand in addition to that they are smaller than the average condom prone to breaking and the material is not the same quality as a real trojan they are clear as glass and feel stiff compared to a real trojan unless you want to uncomfortably conceive a baby during a one night stand just go to the pharmacy so you know what you re buying" "negative"
"4" "this product definitely does what it s supposed to do the real question is do you need it in my younger years i definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation sex was great for me but i doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes so i regularly used condoms like these only a different brand fortunately i m much older now and much more experienced with sex including how to control my body and not get too excited too fast unfortunately i didn t consider that before purchasing these to say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic i couldn t feel a thing i started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town embarrassing to say the least but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it after i switched to a different condom and finished the job for guys who get a little too excited are inexperienced or are just very sensitive this is probably a great product but if you don t already have a problem with staying power i wouldn t recommend that you use these you might find out the hard way that you don t really need any extra help" "negative"
"5" "never had condoms break before i ve tried this one everything was done the same way the same procedure preparation and all as with other condoms but after i saw the big rip on its side i had pretty uneasy several weeks" "negative"
"6" "every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it i have to remove that hard solid stuff to make sure i would not get hurt by this silly condom" "negative"
"7" "yes they are definitely extremely thin and they do indeed feel like bare skin but i ve never had an issue with a condom tearing until i got these i ve used two of them and both have torn at the tip and i almost didn t notice it in time because it already felt like i wasn t wearing anything i don t know if there was a quality control issue or what but i m not going to be using these ever again no unwanted babies for this guy i almost didn t write a review but i felt like i should warn everyone of the tearing issue" "negative"
"8" "i ve used different types of confoms and have never had a problem with one breaking until this type and it s not just a little split his penis breaks completely through so at least we knew we ve tried it different times and they were a brand new box would not recommend" "negative"
"9" "excellent in terms of higher degree of feeling however be careful had them break twice you can t make them thinner without sacrificing strength a serious concern if you re trying to avoid std or pregnancy" "negative"
"10" "i ve been buying trojan condoms for years and have always been satisfied but this are super bad i have had only condom tearing in the last years maybe but this i had tearing in the last month i still like trojan but this model is super bad dont risk it" "negative"
"11" "totally fine condom if your partner likes ribbed condoms this is one of the more intensely ribbed options the thicker ribs make the entire condom feel thicker though and when coupled with the very annoying lubricant gets everywhere and tastes absolutely terrible it results in a condom that is kinda meh but no breaks or children so it does its job" "negative"
"12" "this box is ok if you want to try lifestyles variety in non laytex i am allergic to laytex so these are great and actually feel better than regular laytext condoms however within this variety box me and my bf found that the extra lubricated inside and outside condom ones where just a pain in the ass no pun intended heheheh they just slip around and almost come right off if your not careful we felt we had to constantly check it to make sure it didn t come off and it was more of a mood killer the other condoms in the box are great and stay put" "negative"
"13" "great product except my vagina is very sensitive to the lubricant on the condoms which caused me to get a yeast infection so i have to use your non lubricant ones which are great" "negative"
"14" "much thinner then previous magnums it s annoying though that i can t seem to find the magnum xl anymore these ones fit very tight and left a deep purple ring on my penis and as in sure most of you reading this are aware these don t cover the entire length of the penis either if they made these a little longer wider i feel like they would be my go to condom hopefully they ll see enough of us complaining and make the magnum xl in a bare skin style" "negative"
"15" "i have tried the lifestyle extended condom before and it was a quarter of the numbness of this trojan condom this condom will numb you and your partner if i was the only one getting numb it would not be too bad but it becomes alot more less pleasurable when your partner is numb too since i already bought it i use the strategy of putting on this condom then changing it before we have sex i much prefer the lifestyles condom even though trojan is considered a better brand" "negative"
"16" "i really didn t like this product thought it was going to help make things last a little longer but it actually made me go numb or at least that s what it felt like which in turn if you cant feel anything down there at all it tends to go limp" "negative"
"17" "these were doing the job a little to well hearing holy s you re still going or you need to get off i finished times is great but what about my needs i don t want to take that long you can hardly feel anything" "negative"
"18" "they are great if you have sex a lot but if you cannot ejaculate with a condom then do not buy this lifestyles skyn and trojan bareskin work a lot better i wish i could use these because condoms for is awesome unfortunately i cannot use them" "negative"
"19" "thick stinky gooey very gooey gooey lube stays on your hands after you touch the condom if you touch your woman it will be disgustful touch for you and for her don t think you can wipe the lube off your hands it will be still sticky so after putting it on you are going to have to go to the bathroom or kitchen to wash your hands with soap or maybe even kerosene they stretch like almost all lifestyles condoms few moves and the condom is hanging off like dough oddly shaped made in india there is nothing else to tell they are garbage it s bizarre how people could write positive reviews for the low quality products like this one" "negative"
"20" "only used out of a package of one broke before sex and the other during sex appropriate name since they really are invisible and you feel everything mostly since half way through sex they break avoid unless your looking for waterballoons for the birthday party of the kids you conceive while wearing these" "negative"
"21" "i don t ever do reviews but after my experience with this brand i had to let others know i wish i could give this zero stars i ve used so far and yes two have broken during sex spend your money elsewhere" "negative"
"22" "the material is really nice but they are small it would be nice if they came in another size" "negative"
"23" "i have to say that when you must use condom you want to feel like you don t have one on and durex invisible is not it it is okay if you are not picky but i am after trying several assortments my favorite is durex extra sensitive i highly recommend them they are super thin and they are the closest thing to feeling like you are dipping your candle without one knock on wood i have never had not one rip or tear on me even with rough use remember i am talking about durex extra sensitive condoms not this starred one" "negative"
"24" "not a fan of the fire ice condoms but over all a good value note none of these condoms have a reserve tip thing in them" "negative"
"25" "there is nothing remotely appearing as ecstacy in these condoms the lubrication reeks something awful the sizes are for larger than average guys and that can cause issues these condoms do not add anything and actually take more away from the experience i personally prefer the bare skin ones which are not included in this pack i would try one of these in a smaller pack and see if you like them before wasting money" "negative"
"26" "honestly the only one that did anything was the fire and ice and that because it burned both of like a movie if you are looking to spice up your bed game get a vibrator or something my girlfriend said she liked the standard trojans more than anything in that box" "negative"
"27" "the box i received was almost near expiration date that s in only a few months typical shelf life for a newly purchased batch is years from manufacture check your boxes and make sure of the expiration date" "negative"
"28" "although these might seem legit its not the real deal this is an a class duplicate of the original durex brand the rubber felt slightly different and rougher i bought the same box instead from a pharmacy and compared condoms they were in fact different the ones here seem to be a very identical duplicate though after comparing it to another same durex real feel i cant really say they were the same it felt different and i noticed instantly they did the job though its an ok condom" "negative"
"29" "the product received was years old and expires in months" "negative"
"30" "disappointed and received the individuals in a ziplock unlike shown in the picture" "negative"
"31" "came in a package of individuals wrapped in sandwich bags not cool" "negative"
"32" "i was so excited about these i bought several packs my junk is like get that thing away from me at the site of a condom excitement turns to oh god so i bought these thinking thinnest condoms in the world great i went to put it on wow non latex condoms sure are hard to unroll meanwhile i m totally losing my erection this is ridiculous i thought to myself i also remembered reading reviews that stated the same thing but you know how some reviewers are once i got this thing unrolled lmao listen i m not even going to sit here and act like i got some super sized i consider myself average size but these things were so tight i don t even think i could get fully erect as i felt like my frickin circulation was being cut off down there in fact it was so tight and uncomfortable i looked down only to see more poor being strangled by this condom not trying to be funny if you have a small erect penis you re in luck these will likely work for you if you re average or above average fageddaboutit i couldn t do it i could no longer stay up with this thing on so i tossed it and reverted to the tried and true trojan bareskin only because i had a few lying around i m going back to the best condoms ever crown those are the closest thing to nothing latex condoms that actually you re going to get and trust me i ve been researching this for years i was extremely disappointed to spend as much as i did on these condoms and not get to experience what the thinnest condom in the world felt like clearly the filling of my penis being strangled and having it s circulation cut off was a stronger feeling than the thinness of this condom" "negative"
"33" "ripped luckily i noticed in time" "negative"
"34" "these are alright the studs are almost unnoticeable and they cause this to be a thicker condom i would say it s closer to a durex in feel but slightly more sensitive than a durex good to see new product development but unless your looking for the novelty of a studded condom i recommend using the non studded bareskin condom" "negative"
"35" "they are soo small they break like crazy" "negative"
"36" "does its job girlfriend can t feel the studs the lube inside the condoms dries too quickly it s alright but most likely i ll stick to other condoms from the same brand" "negative"
"37" "disappointed and received the individuals in a ziplock unlike shown in the picture" "negative"
"38" "came in a package of individuals wrapped in sandwich bags not cool" "negative"
"39" "it s very thin and i suppose my ex liked it she said it felt a lot better than trojan and other brands but i didn t really like it on me it kinda felt sluggish not really smooth feeling for me it s very durable though never broke" "negative"
"40" "ran a bit tight on my bf when he fits well into regular condoms or condoms from any other brand ended up giving him rash like scuff marks at the head and made sex less enjoyable on some occasions he couldn t finish because of the discomfort we used lube but it only helped so much the problem is the condom it is surprisingly durable though considering how thin it is" "negative"
"41" "wish the ribbed are all the way from top to bottom not just the bottom part but still nice condoms" "negative"
"42" "meh he can t feel as much with these and neither can i not too thrilled with the ribbing when we re just getting going but it s less noticeable as we get into it we can t get enough of the bareskin style ones tho" "negative"
"43" "trojan did some research and thought they came up with a condom that would please every woman i m not sure what women they surveyed to design this but i sure as hell wasn t one of them it really is rather boring and actually the design that is supposed to make it better makes it worse average condoms have a thickness of this condom has the same thickness this makes no sense they should have made it thinner to enhance feeling i love my guys natural texture and with a thick condom i can t feel that raw man design the average condom is long this condom is the same the reservoir tip is much larger than average condoms this is the only positive part of the different design this allows for more ejaculation room and allows it to be possible for you to feel this also i would not recommend using this condom if you are longer than inches average shaft and base width for condoms is the her pleasure condom is the same this does not accommodate for guys on the thicker side average condom head width is this condom has a head width of this provides extra head room too much actually the idea behind this was that the extra room would cause heat through friction this idea may sound cool but it doesn t work it just bunches and doesn t fell good at all the only good thing about this is that it provides even more room for ejaculate if it is needed the water based lubrication is average the latex smell is non existent which is great trojan was spot on with this my biggest complaint about condoms is the smell and lingering taste the shaft of this condom has a weird ribbed pattern only on the lower or inches of the condom this is useless read more" "negative"
"44" "the high quality i expect from trojan is here in the latex and the lubricant my only complaint is that it says no where on the packaging that these are meant for men with greater than average girth good product for well endowed men" "negative"
"45" "doesn t slip or anything but i don t know that it heightens her my pleasure as they claim the ones they used to have were great but it seems they ve made some changes and not in the best direction" "negative"
"46" "i m giving stars only because it arrived on time other than that i am very disappointed in the fact that they advertised different flavors and rainbow colors yet when you get the package it s just different types not really a variety being that there s a total of so i would expect more of an assortment especially since that is what the picture and description displays to you as you can see in the picture i only got different types and just my luck i got a huge amount of purple which happens to be our least favorite type of durex condom definitely a let down to now we got all excited for a variety and were sadly disappointed" "negative"
"47" "whats going on durex i got my first bowl that didn t have a cover so i called amazon and they sent me a new one and it came without a cover despite there being a cover on all the pictures on amazon so lets call it what it really is a game of pickup you even put it in one of the tipsiest shapes known to man the fishbowl maybe you figure many will be lost and you will have quicker reorders would the cents for a cover break the bank at durex" "negative"
"48" "have always enjoyed okamoto products but these were nothing spectacular and the lubricant irritated my girlfriend will not be repurchasing" "negative"
"49" "thicker than durex avanti durex extra sensitive and okamoto also this smells worse than normal latex condoms i didn t know that was even possible it s two stars instead of one because i haven t had one break on me yet" "negative"
"50" "the product arrived on time and as described i only tried them once though they seem to be better than the regular latex ones i haven t noticed any rash or allergies yet but it s too soon to tell i was checking the price at wall mart the other day and i saw the same box for a better price i didn t like the fact the box was crushed when arrived to my place i would give more stars if the package and the price were better especially the packaging part since i use these for my own protection i want them to arrive safe and not crushed" "negative"
"51" "yes they are definitely extremely thin and they do indeed feel like bare skin but i ve never had an issue with a condom tearing until i got these i ve used two of them and both have torn at the tip and i almost didn t notice it in time because it already felt like i wasn t wearing anything i don t know if there was a quality control issue or what but i m not going to be using these ever again no unwanted babies for this guy i almost didn t write a review but i felt like i should warn everyone of the tearing issue" "negative"
"52" "i ve used different types of confoms and have never had a problem with one breaking until this type and it s not just a little split his penis breaks completely through so at least we knew we ve tried it different times and they were a brand new box would not recommend" "negative"
"53" "excellent in terms of higher degree of feeling however be careful had them break twice you can t make them thinner without sacrificing strength a serious concern if you re trying to avoid std or pregnancy" "negative"
"54" "i ve been buying trojan condoms for years and have always been satisfied but this are super bad i have had only condom tearing in the last years maybe but this i had tearing in the last month i still like trojan but this model is super bad dont risk it" "negative"
"55" "partner thought it felt better than a male condom but it got pushed inside we were unprotected for a minute had to hold it in place the rest of the time i won t buy again" "negative"
"56" "i think that these are a great option if your partner has erectile issues and you need extra protection i am married and monogamous and cannot do hormone birth control i also use spermicide the combo left me with a god awful smell but id rather deal with a smell for a couple of days even after bathing than everything that can come from not using protection i find that missionary position works best so you can hold on to the condom switching positions didn t work out too well so for me once you put it in and start a position stay in that position if you can the spermicidal lube really helped the feeling for my spouse good luck" "negative"
"57" "i purchased these because i have allergies to most lubes including the lubes on most condoms also the lubes in condoms are generally not toy safe and i have some expensive high end toys that i like to use with partners i will not be purchasing these again i use them properly i put lube inside the tip and on the outside of the condom every single one has broken most break while they are being rolled down and some broke while it was being smoothed down the shaft" "negative"
"58" "i guess you get what you pay for these condoms going on pretty snug but during use they stretch out a lot luckily the ring base is tight enough that we haven t had one come off but if you pull out to change positions you ll notice that it eventually starts to look like you maybe tried to slip on a condom that s a bit too big for you they get the job done but you and your partner deserve better" "negative"
"59" "totally fine condom if your partner likes ribbed condoms this is one of the more intensely ribbed options the thicker ribs make the entire condom feel thicker though and when coupled with the very annoying lubricant gets everywhere and tastes absolutely terrible it results in a condom that is kinda meh but no breaks or children so it does its job" "negative"
"60" "i have used these before and loved them when i first bought them from the departmental store so i decided to order them online from amazon trust me they were totally tampered with the box was open and had no plastic wrap on the box i chose to ignore it and opened the box to find that there were no pleasure pack condoms and they had been replaced with normal trojan condoms all condoms were the same color as opposed to how they should have been different types and colors i trashed them because i was scared who might have touched them" "negative"
"61" "this is a rip off i only got one of the condoms that was advertised which was the sensations one other than that i received totally different condoms that aren t apart of the real pleasure pack do not buy from this wholesaler" "negative"
"62" "the product was advertised to have fire and ice by what was delivered was warming which is similar but never the less it would be nice to get what is advertised" "negative"
"63" "we got these because the price was lower then at the store they were advertised with fire and ice but when we got them there were none it was an assortment but not the assortment we ordered they are trojan and they do the job or at least they have so far but i would beware you aren t going to get fire and ice in them" "negative"
"64" "they work well as far as not ripping but my boyfriend did not care for the way most of them felt he only like the warm one i couldn t really tell that much of a difference except for with two the warm and sensation almost like not wearing one at all" "negative"
"65" "it feels like nothing s there because it probably broke i ve never had a condom break on me until now i only purchased this laughably because i wanted to try something new and the reviews were great if you re not ready to bring new life into this world because you have toys to buy and places to see stick to trojan or durex" "negative"
"66" "these used to be my favorite condoms either i ve changed or they have but these used to be a perfect fit and now they re too snug too stiff and overall just not comfortable to wear go get free condoms somewhere don t waste your money on awful uncomfortable condoms" "negative"
"67" "i don t want to unnecessarily scare anyone but my husband and i had used more expensive name brand condoms trojan and durex for the past years with complete success within a month of switching to these one broke i m currently weeks pregnant could it have been a coincidence yes could another brand of condom have broken of course and i m excited for the new baby and all but i will not be relying on these again in the future" "negative"
"68" "these are way too thick to be pleasurable they are like an armor coating i guess they would be reliable as a contraceptive and std protection due to this property but on the fun scale these are a flop" "negative"
"69" "these are not authentic durex products they are manufactured in china not an official durex location with materials that are not up to standard do not buy these" "negative"
"70" "chinese condoms save your money" "negative"
"71" "a pungent rubber like stench not exactly an aphrodisiac also can t feel a darn thing for some people the spermicide will hurt it did for me and it also does nothing as you need a lot more spermicide than what the condom offers in order to have an effect better off getting some microthins without spermicide" "negative"
"72" "after years of trying and failing to have kids we stopped worrying about birth control then our daughter surprised us last year now we have to worry about it for the first time in years condoms never bothered me when i was younger now that i m older and haven t had to wear one in forever they don t seem as comfortable these are okay do what they need to do i certainly wouldn t consider them to be ultra sensitive or anything special i do know that i always preferred lifestyles back in the day" "negative"
"73" "do not use these condoms lack lubrication and have come off times during intercourse in the past year lodging themselves deep inside my partner s vagina at first we thought this was the result of human error but then we realized it only happened with this specific condom i have never had a similar incident in many years of sex with all different brands and models of condoms and neither has my partner this is a highly ineffective not to mention dangerous product" "negative"
"74" "this product definitely does what it s supposed to do the real question is do you need it in my younger years i definitely had a problem with premature ejaculation sex was great for me but i doubt that my partners got the same amount of enjoyment out of their three minutes so i regularly used condoms like these only a different brand fortunately i m much older now and much more experienced with sex including how to control my body and not get too excited too fast unfortunately i didn t consider that before purchasing these to say that these condoms reduced sensitivity is a bit of an understatement in my case between the thickness of the condom itself and the benzocaine anesthetic i couldn t feel a thing i started to get a little bit worried about the condom working too well and worry is the last thing that you want in the bedroom anxiety plus delay lubricant put me on a one way ticket to flaccid town embarrassing to say the least but my girlfriend is awesome and we both had a laugh about it after i switched to a different condom and finished the job for guys who get a little too excited are inexperienced or are just very sensitive this is probably a great product but if you don t already have a problem with staying power i wouldn t recommend that you use these you might find out the hard way that you don t really need any extra help" "negative"

"76" "every condom in this box has a weird solid stuff inside it i have to remove that hard solid stuff to make sure i would not get hurt by this silly condom" "negative"
"77" "this is for men with somewhat extra girth mine is inches circumference and this condom will fit maximum only inches and almost strangling the member in its base xl is misleading even when this might be the biggest trojan condom fda is doing a very unhealthy dangerous and unintelligent job by limiting the size of condoms sold in the usa specially in girth shame on them european brands like mysize theyfit and pasante are built with similar quality standards as trojan and they have much real larger sizes the problem is that it is very difficult to get them by the way compare the magnum trojan xl packaging size with another brand at least it appears impressive and it will give an ego boost to the user if xl is their biggest product go imagine the small size of those working at trojan and the fda" "negative"
"78" "the three stars is only because the size of the base ring is much tighter than i expected after doing a lot of research and was expecting it to fit closer to a regular condom maybe around mm in width and it was much tighter and the three stars is not for the quality sagami condom brand for a male with around four and three quarters inches anatomy width who can wear most regular u s condoms such as durex that may be about mm width that fit basically comfortable on the base ring these sagami original were extremely difficult to put on as or more difficult than the okamoto regular as this sagami original had to be unrolled about two rolls to start getting it on once on the shaft was ok but the base ring of these sagami original was very much way too tight leaves an indentation and were uncomfortable while on and therefore personally these sagami original were not comfortable to use so unfortunately i threw out the rest of the box i do not use a magnum as for someone around average a regular condom is more than enough so these sagami original are much tighter than a standard condom on the base ring the length of these sagami original is about just over six inches in length i would not buy these again unless it was said it was new and improved with a stretchier base ring i don t know if the sagami large maybe about mm width would be too wide and maybe someday if they lower the price or have a sample pack or have a three pack then maybe i will try the sagami large to see how those fit in width i really like the sagami containers for packaging and i would pay more for any condom in these great containers for now for the times i use polyurethane condoms i will use the okamoto large that fit closer to a regular condom because for me the base ring was too tight on these sagami original" "negative"
"79" "i ll admit i m not as well endowed as some guys and i figured since that is the case i d try these out well i don t know who i m going to give these too but they are way too tight for me something i thoughti d never say but i can t use them as once i finally got one on i felt like i was in a vice just going to say if you are on the average side of average you know what i mean you may want toget a small pack and try them first before buying more" "negative"
"80" "these were pretty good my only complaint is that most of them in the box smelled a bit weird almost like an animal died or something not very pleasurable to smell that during an intimate moment and no the condoms weren t past date" "negative"
"81" "like having sex with a plastic bag on no enjoyment whatsoever might help if they were thinner i thought they would be considering the name i gave one star because at least they didn t have that awful latex smell none of that mattered because i d rather take the latex smell over the it feels like i m having sex with a plastic bag wrapped around my" "negative"
"82" "where were the name brands mentioned in the ad got reality thin and ultra thin beyond seven only name i recognized and python no trojan lifestyles durex trustex atlas or even crown a few are expired definitely a disappointment it said all of those names along with many more in the ad definitely falsely advertised so they could dump crappy unknown brands figured i might see a few i didn t know but not the case here would have paid the dollar more and gotten a mixed variety by all one brand if i d known this was what i d get" "negative"
"83" "suppose to have and it only came with" "negative"
"84" "we have purchased the bundles a few times within the last few years this time around we found the condoms received were on the slight cheap end we only received maybe one known brand trojan and the rest were cheap ones from asia we ended up tossing out a few just because the quality was so questionable the last time was better but i guess it depends on your luck" "negative"
"85" "ordered these for the variety so the wife and i could find out what we liked the best what i received was of the same brand reality and of another shibari i have no doubt these will keep us not pregnant and the price is good but i took stars off for the lack of variety" "negative"
"86" "terribly deceptive product they should say they are scented not flavored as they have absolutely zero taste other than lubricated rubber to top it off they didn t even smell like they described a big waste of money" "negative"
"87" "pretty good they fit really snug almost too snug but they don t break so there s that from what i m told however there isn t a large amount of flavor i am told that the mint ones apparently taste terrible and strawberry is the best if anything they do smell nice either way may try some others" "negative"
"88" "fake paid for counts with metal box but came in counts and also paper box" "negative"
"89" "these were awful if i could give a zero i would the shape is just awkward and there is nothing about these that give ecstasy unless your man is huge these are big and just weird once on i would never buy these again going back to old school plain jane condoms without any frills do not waste your money on these" "negative"
"90" "no trouble with breakage but that is its only redeeming quality strong foul odor lubricant felt like vaseline our genitals felt like they d had car wax applied leave these and use something else" "negative"
"91" "if i could give it a i would these things reek to high heaven the ribbing is nothing more than a pencil line and the shape matches no male anatomy i ve ever encountered frigging yuck" "negative"
"92" "these smelled very strong and unappealing they are much wider than other condoms they are alright for using as protection however i would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person no complaints from a women s perspective besides the smell from a mans perspective these are a big no stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good" "negative"
"93" "i refuse to use these only because they are not what is advertised the packaging looks different even though they say its the same product ultra thin line of trapan s also even without opening a single condom they feel cheaper and thinner than the same condom i got in a pack from walmart a few weeks ago these are not made in the usa like the description says they say made in thailand on the back the actual trojan is located on the left of my pictures this nonsense they sent me is on the right i would not trust these unless you re looking for baby mamma drama in about months" "negative"
"94" "first of all these are not real us trojan condoms they are a knockoff made in thailand when my husband and i got married we bought the variety pack from amazon which has different kind of condoms in them he liked the ultra thin ones so i decided to buy the big pack instead of wasting my money at cvs where they are like each if you look at the photo where there s two condoms the packaging is completely different the one on the right side of the photo is the real trojan condom that came in the variety pack and the one on the left is the one made in thailand so not only is the packaging different but they feel completely different as well these thailand ones are so much thinner so out of break which i ve never had a real trojan condom break so just a warning to all these are fake unless you want a baby do not purchase these" "negative"
"95" "do not buy these are thai knock off condoms and not genuine trojans they are not made in the usa they are made in thailand in addition to that they are smaller than the average condom prone to breaking and the material is not the same quality as a real trojan they are clear as glass and feel stiff compared to a real trojan unless you want to uncomfortably conceive a baby during a one night stand just go to the pharmacy so you know what you re buying" "negative"

"106" "i bought these because my partner and i really enjoyed this type of condom from the durex variety pack we had purchased however he said that these felt much tighter than the previous ones we had used from the same brand in fact there was a visible constriction of his penis around the base of the condom i was surprised given the excellent track record we have with durex but at least none of them broke" "negative"

"109" "ah does the jorrb not anything different than others as far as lubricant or feeling at least it didn t break when i think about condoms trojan is all i think about i mean they have pushed the product better than other companies if that s a good thing or maybe they are so huge in the industry that they squeeze everyone else out anyway yea they are ok but if you are lookin for the next best thing to goin ala natural they haven t hit that benchmark yet" "negative"
"110" "i was excited as soon as i saw the commercial for these condoms and bought them same day the first one worked fine but neither my partner nor i could tell any difference between these and the classic ribbed but it went down hill from there the other two times we attempted to use these condoms the friction started to burn so bad we stopped having sex even adding our own lubricant to didn t seem to help we agreed to go back to the classic trojan ribbed and just throw away the rest of this box" "negative"

"113" "i was severely disappointed after buying these condoms why because within a few weeks of purchasing them i received an e mail from amazon com notifying me that the batch had been recalled due to quality issues and thus shouldn t be used wow that really inspires my confidence in lifestyle rubbers not now i use kimono microthin condoms made in japan and okamoto crown assorted colors both are of much higher quality" "negative"
"114" "this is the only brand of condom my partner and i have ever snapped i think it was the skyn but honestly it happened during application so i wouldn t let that sway you these are decent condoms for both sides but they seem a little smaller than most condoms we buy didn t fit well i think we will go back to using trojan ecstasy but this lifestyles pleasure collection is a decent buy" "negative"
"115" "they are on the small side honestly it felt like my member was being choked to death not to mention the rubber is pretty thick to it gets rid of too much of the sensation but if you need a snug fit that kills sperm these are it" "negative"

"119" "these smelled very strong and unappealing they are much wider than other condoms they are alright for using as protection however i would not recommend them due to the overpowering smell and the very wide width wont fit an average or even well endowed sized person no complaints from a women s perspective besides the smell from a mans perspective these are a big no stars for the fact that it does provide protection but other than that these are no good" "negative"
"120" "my wife and i thought these were pretty decent for latex condoms but we both enjoy the okamoto ex polyurethane much better the s are much more expensive at over a a piece i would stick with these for affordable standard latex condoms but if you re looking for something thin because you don t like the feeling of condoms i would recommend the s" "negative"

"122" "why do they smell so awful when you open up one gross" "negative"
"123" "decent cheap condoms i used them for masturbation particularly while being a guest and they generally do the job i did once or twice notice a little semen on my sheets so they can occasionally tear and they are a little hard to take off even when my erection is gone i prefer the lifestyles and durex condoms but they re more expensive" "negative"
"124" "after nearly a decade of using okamoto crown condoms exclusively my husband and i are sad to say that we re going to have to find another brand ordinarily and regardless of whether or not they were manufactured in thailand these condoms had almost no discernible odor and didn t cause any irritation for either one of us the condoms in the last pack we purchased smelled like a pile of burning tires not only that but they also caused quite a bit of swelling and irritation the lot number and expiration date were e tz and respectively the only reason i m divulging this particular information is because i d be very curious to know whether or not others have noticed this change or we simply got a bad batch either way we have to begin the search for a new brand of condom preferably one that doesn t smell like burning rubber or cause the sort of irritation these now cause" "negative"
"125" "this gets star because it s not thecrown condoms you would expect these are not the same crown condoms that are made in japan these ones are made in thailand what s the difference these thailand manufactured condoms smell strongly of rubber and have very little lube i m just warning any of you who have read great reviews on these because the ones made in japan are actually really great these thailand condoms are cheap and stinky to be fair the fit seems to be roughly the same feels a bit tighter and my girlfriend and i used one when we ran out of good condoms durex super thin extra sensitive condoms and it wasn t awful minus the really disgusting smell major turn off the point is you don t want a condom that smells so bad that it makes you wish you had something else or none at all definitely go with the durex extra sensitive on this one they are a bit wider they are just as thin as the crown skinless skin they have no smell or taste are lubed generously and i ve used hundreds of them with no breaks" "negative"
"126" "i was expecting a sealed box instead i got a bag with ct just as described the seller should say they come in a ziploc type bag other than that they fit snug alright" "negative"
"127" "when they say snug they should say hulk hogan death grip i was hoping for something slightly more snug but these actually hurt if left on too long feels super tight for the price its worth trying them for yourself don t read reviews for condoms and hope to find your answer here trial and error is your best bet" "negative"
"128" "the product we received was significantly past the sell by date and likely over the shelf life as such these condoms are little more than a novelty and offer no protection terrible purchase" "negative"

"130" "just received that pack and it s just a bunch of loose condoms in a bubble envelope it s sketchy and i m not even sure i d trust using them it says nowhere in the description that it won t come in factory sealed boxes so i ll probably end up throwing them in the garbage not worth risking an std or pregnancy over" "negative"

"137" "wow umm when they say this is a snug fit they mean snug fit i never considered myself to be big always thought i was on the smaller side but these were too snug for me putting them on turned out to be a hassle and felt uncomfortable the part that i felt was odd about these were that despite the snugness the sleeves were a lot longer than i had expected i m glad that i bought a small pack to try before jumping into this one and would recommend this to anyone that is considering buying it try it out first before buying that count box" "negative"

"143" "although technically thinner than the sagami original i find the aoni to be inferior in terms of sensation the sagami felt a lot better for me additionally i find the sagami to be of better production quality in several ways the aoni s lubricant isn t very evenly applied the head portion is too wet while the base portion is often entirely dry the sagami has very even application of lube the thickness of the aoni seems to be uneven the head is probably thin enough to be is it technically but the material seems to increase in thickness toward the base or so it feels the sagami on the other hand is very uniform in thickness and provides very good sensitivity over the entire length" "negative"
