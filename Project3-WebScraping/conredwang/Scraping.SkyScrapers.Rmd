```{r, echo=FALSE}
tall100 = read.table('data/tall.txt', header=FALSE, sep='|', na.strings=(NA))
colnames(tall100) = c(
'hgtRank', 'hgtFeet', 'blgName', 'blgCity', 'blgCountry',

'forHotel', 'forRetail', 'yrPropose', 'yrStart', 'yrComplete',
'tmProposeStart', 'tmProposeComplete', 'tmStartComplete'
)
```
## Statistics of these 100 buildings:
- `r length(tall100$isMultiPurpose[tall100$isMultiPurpose=='Y'])` are multipurpose.
- `r length(tall100$forOffice[tall100$forOffice=='Y'])` are used for office.
- `r length(tall100$forHotel[tall100$forHotel=='Y'])` are used for hotel.
- `r length(tall100$forResidential[tall100$forResidential=='Y'])` are used for residential.
- `r length(tall100$forRetail[tall100$forRetail=='Y'])` are used for retail.
- `r sum(is.na(tall100$yrPropose))` do not have Proposed Year listed.
- `r sum(is.na(tall100$yrStart))` do not have Construction Start Year listed.

## A few thoughts

Two out of three ain't bad, right?  But, I won't conclude the formula is a fact, as I think the asian adult sample in 1994 *Adult* dataset (895) seems too small.  A conclusion should be drawn after explored more samples from multiple years.

As an asian myself, I listen and obey my parents as they always want the best for me.  Most things change as time evolves; thus, it is reasonable to say very few things hold true forever.  But, parents' care for their children never change.  

You may ask, "Are you sure?"  **"Yes, because I told you so!!!"**
