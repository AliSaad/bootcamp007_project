## A few thoughts

Two out of three ain't bad, right?  But, I won't conclude the formula is a fact, as I think the asian adult sample in 1994 *Adult* dataset (895) seems too small.  A conclusion should be drawn after explored more samples from multiple years.

As an asian myself, I listen and obey my parents as they always want the best for me.  Most things change as time evolves; thus, it is reasonable to say very few things hold true forever.  But, parents' care for their children never change.  

You may ask, "Are you sure?"  **"Yes, because I told you so!!!"**

Sincerely, Conred Wang.
