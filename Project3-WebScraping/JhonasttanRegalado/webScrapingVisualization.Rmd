Visualize the Starbucks locations and their amenities.
1. Scrapy for store locators
2. Leaflet for visualization
3. ML clustering for grouping the stores based on amenities
4. Map layer for citibikeanallysis app

```{r}
#Load data rendered by Scrapy
library(tidyverse)
df_sb <- read.csv('./starbucks/StarbucksStores.txt', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
View(df_sb)
head(df_sb)
```

Completed ability to scrape for Starbucks locations in NYC via scraper. Am getting duplicate entries, but leaving to Carto to locate based on unique geospatial info for now.
