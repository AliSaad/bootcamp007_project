                                                           Iâ€™ve asked a few Citi Bike subscribers about their experience, and yes, some have dealt with a pothole or two; therefore, was interested in understanding the logistics. 
                                                           How are the stations replenished and how do users typically deal with bike capacity constraints when they really need a bike. 
                                                           Do they go to a nearby station, or hail a cab?

                                                          The effort has led to a modified goal. To use this working prototype as a concept that introduces web site feature enrichments to the end user experience during their daily interaction with the

                                                          The proposed ideas could be integrated into their product development pipeline.
